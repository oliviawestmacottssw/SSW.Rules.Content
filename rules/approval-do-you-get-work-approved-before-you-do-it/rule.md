<p>&quot;Sometimes it's better to ask forgiveness than permission&quot; - Tony Abbott</p>
<p>The trouble is that the above is predicated on the notion that you're doing something wrong and are happy spending time putting out fires that needn't have been lit.<br>&#160;<br>Let's see how to&#160;live without stomach ulcers... </p>

<dl class="image" style="width&#58;207px;float&#58;right;clear&#58;right;"><dt><img alt="Get work approved and spend less time putting out fires" src="/Management/RulesToHappyClients/PublishingImages/SuccessfulProjects_PuttingOutFires.jpg" /> </dt>

<p>Get permission for the work you do <strong>*before*</strong> you do it. Usually get permission verbally, <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/EmailToMyself.aspx">confirmed with an email&#160;</a> (or with a <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/UseEmailSignatures.aspx" shape="rect">signature</a>, although that's sometimes a whole lot harder). </p>
<p>The natural time for this conversation to occur is in the <a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DailyStandUpScrum.aspx">Daily Scrum</a></p>
<p>Always get permission for&#58; </p>
<ul><li><a href="/Management/RulesToHappyClients/Pages/DoYouGetApprovalForAdditionalItemsAndWhenEstimatesWillBeExceeded.aspx" shape="rect">Additional Items</a> </li>
<li><a href="/Management/RulesToHappyClients/Pages/DoYouGetApprovalForAdditionalItemsAndWhenEstimatesWillBeExceeded.aspx" shape="rect">Exceeding estimates</a> </li>
<li><a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/PerformMigrationProceduresWithAnApprovedReleasePlan.aspx" shape="rect">Data migration</a> </li></ul>
<p>Having said that, you need to manage two potential problems with seeking permission on work before acting&#58; </p>
<ul><li>Increased dead time while waiting for approval </li>
<li>Discouraging initiative to <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBeingSoftwareConsultantsDealingWithClients.aspx#FixProblemsFast" shape="rect">fix problems&#160;quickly</a></li></ul>
<p>This rule is not generally applicable if&#58; </p>
<ul><li>You are working on an <a href="/Management/RulesToBeingSoftwareConsultants-DealingWithClients/Pages/Ad-hocWorkAndProjectManagedWork.aspx" shape="rect">ad hoc</a> basis on a&#160;client managed project </li>
<li>The task is an obvious task which you would <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/AssumeNecessaryTasks.aspx" shape="rect">reasonably assume the client would approve</a> and is not likely to take more than half an hour. </li></ul>
