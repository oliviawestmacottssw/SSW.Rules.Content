<p>You always need to collaborate with your customer.&#160; They want to see new mockups, comment on features, get new releases and participate in team discussions on their particular project.</p>
<p>So the first thing you should do is to create a customer portal in your SharePoint extranet, and give your&#160;customer a login so they can jump in and get involved!</p>
<p>We use a customized SharePoint Team Collaboration site template to quickly initialize a new site for our customers.</p>
<p>Do you know how to create a customer portal?</p>
