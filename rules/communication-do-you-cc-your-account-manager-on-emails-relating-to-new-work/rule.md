Once a project gets underway, it is not uncommon for the development team to take                     over a lot of the project management workload. Since they are the people most in                     contact with the client, sometimes new work will be organized through them instead                     of the Account Manager.

<!--endintro-->

When this is the case, the "As per our conversation" email should CC the Account Manager                     so he is always aware of all work being done, and can create a [new CRM opportunity](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=c797ad7b-cbb5-4266-8687-e5ca52c1aa6d) if required.

If an initial meeting is required for the new work, the Account Manager should be in attendance                     where possible to help continue the relationship.

                        <p>Hi Bill,<br>
                           As per our conversation, you want to book me&#160;for another 2 weeks on this additional work.</p>
                    &lt;/dt&gt;
