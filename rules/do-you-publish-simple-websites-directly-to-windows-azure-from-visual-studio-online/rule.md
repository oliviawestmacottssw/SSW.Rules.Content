<p>TFS and Windows Azure work wonderfully together. It only takes a minute to configure continuous deployment from Visual Studio Online (visualstudio.com) to a Windows Azure Web Site or Cloud Service.</p><p>This is by far the most simple method to achieve continuous deployment of your websites to Azure.</p><span style="line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;">But, if your application is more complicated, or you need to run UI tests as part of your deployment, you should be using Octopus Deploy instead.​</span>
