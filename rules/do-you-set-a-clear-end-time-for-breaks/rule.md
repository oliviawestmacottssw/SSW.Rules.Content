When you set a break at a training course, you should make sure you’re first make sure your finish what you are doing. Don’t cut people off because of a clock.
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
Tell them 20 min break (or 1 hour for lunch) and&#58;
<ul>
<li>Let them break</li>
<li>Write in a clear place the end time for the break and ask people to be back on time
<dl>
    <dt><img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Break ends" src="/Communication/RulesToBetterPresentations/PublishingImages/break-ends.jpg" /> </dt>
    <dd class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Clearly show the end time for the break</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>If anyone comes back late – Explain the value of integrity. Honouring your word in small things makes it easier to honour it for the larger things, such as doing your best in a sprint, and makes people believe in you more</li>
</ul>
