Hashtags identify the keyword&#160;or&#160;topic&#160;of&#160;interest&#160;that the post is about. They allow searching&#160;for&#160;similar posts on the topic. They were popularized on twitter and now work on&#160;Facebook, Pinterest, and Google+. On twitter, it is possible to &quot;track&quot; (aka Subscribe to)&#160;a tag.&#160; <br>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">The best tweets will use a combination of @mentions and #hashtags where appropriate to properly leverage the platform – that way readers can check out the people involved OR join the conversation about a topic.

   <strong>Tip&#160;#2&#58; </strong>When creating your own hashtag to promote a service, product or event, check if it isn't already in use for anything else.<br></p><h3>Tips for everyone<br></h3><p>
   <strong>Tip #3&#58; </strong> Don't use too many hashtags – 2 or 3 maximum per post, or you may appear to be &quot;spammy&quot; and turn people off.<br></p><p>
   <strong>Tip #4&#58; </strong> Keep your hashtags on topic – again, you might seem &quot;spammy&quot; if you use hashtags that are unrelated to your post.​<br></p><p><strong>Tip #5</strong>&#58; For more readability, capitalise the first letter of each word, for example,&#160;#SocialMedia.<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Examples of hashtags we use<br></h3><ul><li>​​<b>#SSW</b> - For our company-related&#160;posts<br></li><li>
