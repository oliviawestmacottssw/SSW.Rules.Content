  <p>Often emails are rambling and unorganized, forcing the reader to wade through blocks of totally useless text. When it comes to written communication, less is more. Be concise and to the point, listing only what is relevant. People tend to ignore reading larger emails if they are on the run and leave it&#160;until&#160;a later time when they are not as busy. </p>
<p>&quot;I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.&quot; <br>
Mark Twain </p>
