<p>Did you know that all pilots around the world must speak English? Back then the decision of what language to use, was made as English, since the US invented the first plane. Like the sky, in the web world, it is better to use one version of English. Since the US invented the web, let's go with that.<br></p><p>If you are an Australian or British this rule is controversial, but it is worth it for the following reasons&#58;</p><ul><li>Cater for the majority. Most web traffic is from American users and they expect American (most probably will assume it is an error)</li>
   <li>On the practical side, more web searches are going to be returned for US spelling of words.</li></ul>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">​​Don't forget&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterTechnicalDocumentation.aspx#WordSpellingAndGrammarChecker">after making edits to check your pages for spelling errors</a>.</p><p>At SSW we have a Google Adwords account that allows us to reach a targeted audience based on the keywords they use to search the Internet. While testing the effectiveness of the keywords in our Adwords account, we realised that if we use Australian spelling a lot of our US customers won't find us, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Thus if you are using Adwords or a similar system, it's a good idea to include all variations on the spelling of a word to ensure you don't miss out on any potential customers. The beauty of the system is that if nobody searches on a word it doesn't cost you a cent, so it makes sense to include as many as possible!</p>
