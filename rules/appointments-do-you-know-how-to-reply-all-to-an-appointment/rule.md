Some people&#160;have Outlook calendars that are full to the brim. They&#160;might use their&#160;Calendar to remind them&#160;to do certain personal tasks, they&#160;might have an appointment telling them&#160;that someone else is going on leave, and, of course, they have actual&#160;meetings with clients or colleagues. Their&#160;calendars can get very messy and it's easy to miss sâ€‹omething important.&#160;<div><br></div><div>This is why, when working with someone who has a hectic calendar like this, you&#160;might want to&#160;remind them&#160;by email of your meeting the day before it is scheduled.&#160;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Outlook makes this easy&#58;<br></div>
