<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">In PowerShell, you can easily create variables without explicitly typing them and that leads to some hardcoded "magic" strings.​​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Instead of using XML, JSON, YAML, or TXT files, PowerShell "accidentally" created a very nice configuration file format, PSD1.<br>PSD1 us the filename extension for PowerShell module descriptions, and this file contains metadata for that module. You can, however, load any kind of data from a PSD1 file using a simple cmdlet ​​​<br></p>

It also makes the script much more maintainable, where you can easily change the variables in the .PSD1 file without needing to change your core script.<br>Don't forget to add the configuration file to .gitignore!</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
