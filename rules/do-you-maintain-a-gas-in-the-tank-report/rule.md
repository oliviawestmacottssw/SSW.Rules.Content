​​​We all know the situation but never think it will happen to us. Many businesses believe they are well prepared in the event of a disaster or a downturn in business activity.<br><div><br></div><div>In the unfortunate event that all your customers suddenly stop trading&#160;(meaning your income levels are reduced to zero), do you know how long you can keep the business afloat based on your cash balance, without taking any cost-cutting measures?<br></div><div><br></div><div>It is recommended to keep&#160;track of your Gas in the Tank report at least every month to determine the number of weeks your business will remain afloat in the unlikely event of the above scenario.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For most businesses, a good amount of cash to hold should cover approximately 26 weeks&#160;of costs.&#160;<br></div><div><br></div><div><img alt="2020-05-28_17-14-29.png" src="/SiteAssets/do-you-report-the-business-weekly-gas-in-the-tank/2020-05-28_17-14-29.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /><br></div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure Bad Example​<br><br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">This example shows the first few months have performed well in terms of cash-flow, however, the length of time which the business can survive on cash reserves is not as high as they expect (13 weeks roughly which is not a lot of time to respond). This report would have revealed the calculations and henceforth&#160;increase the business awareness and to keep the foot on the pedal.&#160;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Businesses are often&#160;floored by the unknown which could have simply been discovered a lot earlier and possibly dealt with before it became a problem. Often a business will become satisfied with a good few months of positive cash flow whether it be a result of cost-cutting efforts or improved business activities for those months.&#160;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">As a result, the business can become complacent and not realise their actual ability to stay afloat based on their cash reserves should anything happen with the business activities.<br><br></p><div><img alt="2020-05-28_17-13-50.png" src="/SiteAssets/do-you-report-the-business-weekly-gas-in-the-tank/2020-05-28_17-13-50.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /><br><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure Good Example<br><br><br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><img alt="2020-05-28_17-15-02.png" src="/SiteAssets/do-you-report-the-business-weekly-gas-in-the-tank/2020-05-28_17-15-02.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure Best Example<br></dd><br>​These two examples are an indication of a business that is ensuring their cash reserves are maintained at a sufficient level. They achieve this by either maintaining cost measures low or consistently driving for new customers and a minimum level of business activity.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>This all sounds self-explanatory and simple, however, it is common that a business will feel&#160;positive due to some months of&#160;increased cash reserves and then&#160;fall&#160;off the wagon and become&#160;complacent.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Maintaining a Gas in the Tank report will provide a visual indication and a prompt to revisit costs and&#160;additional&#160;measures in driving business activities, before it becomes a problem.<br></div>
