See our [Suggestions to MS: Check for Updates:](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/Office.aspx#Version)
<br>The best idea is to use SharePoint to manage your templates.<br> 
When you need to create a PowerPoint presentation file, find the latest version of [templates](http&#58;//projects.ssw.com.au/Templates/Forms/AllItems.aspx) here.
![Check version history](/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/PublishingImages/versionHistory.jpg) Figure: Click "Edit" to see the version history of the template file ![Version Number](/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/PublishingImages/versionNo.jpg) Figure: The version number can be seen here
