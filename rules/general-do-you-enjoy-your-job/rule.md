                    If you find yourself not enjoying your job, this is not necessarily a bad thing.
                    You should make a commitment to give it a go and try to make it work. When you have
                    decided you are unhappy, you should talk to your boss and figure out what is making
                    you unhappy.&#160;</p><p><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">The number 1 cause of stress in this industry is ca</span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">used by running out of budget&#160;for a project.&#160;The
                    best way to handle this is</span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;"> to give realistic estimates, and inform the clients as
                    soon as it looks like they will be exceeded. A client who has accepted the realities
                    of his project is less scary than working on code that's already over-budget with
                    an impending unknown client reaction.​</span></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal"><img src="/Management/Rules-to-Better-Software-Consultants-Working-in-a-Team/PublishingImages/hefner.jpg" alt="hefner.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;" />​​</dd><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">​Figure&#58; It's possible to REALLY&#160;enjoy your job<br></dd>
