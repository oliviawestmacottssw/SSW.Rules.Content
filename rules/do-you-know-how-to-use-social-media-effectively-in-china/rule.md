​The biggest mistake most western companies make when embarking on a business journey&#160;in China, is assuming that&#160;their current​ Social Media strategies will work over there.<div>​<br>China is different. There are different rules, platforms and of course,&#160;they have a government controlled firewall that blocks many western platforms your are familiar with,&#160;like Facebook, Twitter, and&#160;YouTube. *Uh oh*. That's right -&#160;none of the platforms you currently use everyday now work in China,&#160;you need a new plan.​​​​<br><br></div>

<p>​China has a huge amount of social media users, there are over&#160;911 million active users - which is huge! In comparison, the&#160;U.S.A only have&#160;207 million users, a small fraction compared to China. It is a huge opportunity for market growth, particularly for app owners who would like to expand their product to millions of users.</p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/PublishingImages/DigitalInChina-1024x576.png" alt="DigitalInChina-1024x576.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;750px;height&#58;421px;" /></dl><p><strong>Figure&#58; According to Social Media experts Hootsuite, there are 911 million active social media users (yellow), 65% of the overall population (red).</strong><br></p><p></p><p>There is one big problem - the digital market in China also&#160;has hundreds of social media platform options. With no big platforms like Google, Facebook, and Twitter to focus on, so who do you target? The biggest platforms in China are&#160;WeChat (instant messaging and social media), Baidu (similar to Google search engine), Weibo (like Facebook and Twitter combined), Youku (similar to YouTube)…&#160;​but there are others that are now trending.<br>&#160;<br>However while we often try to draw comparisons with these platforms with their western counterparts​​, be&#160;aware that even though these Chinese platforms may take the basic concepts and functions from the West, they are equipped with much more diverse features.​<br>&#160;<br>Do you know the best platforms to use in China?
