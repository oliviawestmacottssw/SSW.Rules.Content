<p>It's great when someone adds a much-needed feature<br>...as long as the feature fits in with the project the core contributors have for the project<br>...and it meets the existing coding patterns and engineering standards.</p><p>This is where frustration often starts to set in on open source projects.</p><p>A contributor has a great idea for a feature, or identifies an area where they can add value and does so without consulting with the core contributors who have often spent hundreds of hours working on the project.</p><p>Their contribution might solve their problem, but after it has been accepted it will most likely be left for the core contributors to maintain.</p><div class="greyBox"><p>
