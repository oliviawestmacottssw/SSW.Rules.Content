<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
â€‹<dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="../../assets/NoDirectForError.jpg" alt="No direct for this error" /></dt>
<dd>Figure - Bad Example: User now has to Google to find out how to fix this error</dd></dl>
<dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="../../assets/DirectForError.jpg" alt="Direct for this error" /></dt>
<dd>Figure - Good Example: If you click on the "Get Help..." link on the bottom of the form it will take you to a wiki page with common issues and resolutions</dd></dl>
