<p>With the introduction of Angular2, there has been a big push in ensuring the DOM stays out of your JavaScript code.&#160; It is designed in such a way that an existing angular2 application can be ported to another target by simple replacing the template and template loader.&#160; Projects such as&#160;<a href="http&#58;//angularjs.blogspot.com.au/2016/04/angular-2-react-native.html" target="_blank">Angular2 React Native Renderer​</a>&#160;leverages this to allow native mobile app development in Angular2.&#160;</p><p>For this to work well, there has to be a clear separation between the component’s logic and the component’s view – which means avoiding using the DOM in your component’s code.&#160; This gives a few further advantages&#58;<br></p>
