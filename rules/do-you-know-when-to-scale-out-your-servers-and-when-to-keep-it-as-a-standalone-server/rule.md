<p> You should use&#160;virtualized standalone servers because&#58; </p><ul><li>If one server goes down it does not affect other servers (e.g. a centralized SQL server fails and brings down&#58; CRM, TFS, Reports, Web Server)</li><li>You can just copy the VPC to another computer and it just works, no need to worry about reconfiguring the SQL connection string or web services</li><li>You can just backup the VPC</li></ul><p>

                    However, you should scale out your servers if&#58;

                </p><ul><li>You want the best performance (e.g. A different server for SQL backend and Web frontend)</li></ul>​​
