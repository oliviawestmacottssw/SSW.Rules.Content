<p>​​​When you notice that someone has done something that could have&#160;been done better, make sure you are tactful in your correction/suggestions. When you are giving someone a correction or tip, try to include an URL to back up your point.<br></p><p>For example, if someone sends you an email like that&#58;<br></p>

      <br>Hi Mary,<br> 
      <br>I noticed you did not send an appointment for this meeting. I hope you don't mind, but I have gone ahead and created one so we don't all have to create one individually. <br>We have a number of helpful standards like this which you can have a look at in our <a href=/appointments-do-you-send-outlook-calendar-appointments-when-appropriate>Rules to better Email</a> if you're interested.</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood"> Figure&#58; Good Example <br></dd></dl>
