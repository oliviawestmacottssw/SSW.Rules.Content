General web content should always be written as if read by a newsreader. It is objective and describes its content professionally. A good example of this is Wikipedia.

I don't like JavaScript. I prefer jQuery because...

However, when quoting a testimonial, you should use 1st person writing as if a newsreader had crossed over to an eyewitness for a personal view of the topic.
