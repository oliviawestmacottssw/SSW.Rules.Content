 Encouraging your team to evaluate their peers is a proven method to improve working environment and productivity.​ <br> 
All peers that worked together should evaluate each other by filling the [Peer Evaluation Email](/Management/RulestoBetterSpecificationReviews/Documents/PeerEvaluationEmailTemplate.msg) every month.

The evaluation is done by giving constructive comments in “Start, Stop, Continue”
 e.g. (Start...) checking in with better comments  
 e.g. (Stop...) coding without a user story​   
 e.g. (Continue...) with your helpful SEO comments
