Encouraging your team to evaluate their peers is a proven method to improve working environment and productivity.​ 
<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>All peers that worked together should evaluate each other by filling the <a name="Peer Evaluation Email Template" id="Peer Evaluation Email Template" href="/Documents/PeerEvaluationEmailTemplate.msg" target="_blank">Peer Evaluation Email</a> every month.</p>
<p>The evaluation is done by giving constructive comments in “Start, Stop, Continue”<br>
e.g. (Start...) checking in with better comments  <br>
e.g. (Stop...) coding without a user story​   <br>
e.g. (Continue...) with your helpful SEO comments</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><img src="PeerEvaluation.png" alt="PeerEvaluation.png" style="margin:5px;width:650px;" />​<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure: Example email​​</dd>
