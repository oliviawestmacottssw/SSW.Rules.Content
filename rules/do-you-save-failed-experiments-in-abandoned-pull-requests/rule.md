If you create a branch intending to develop a cool new feature but the result is not something that will be merged into master. Make sure to create a Pull Request anyway and set the status to Abandoned. Also make sure to link this PR with the related PBI. Feel free to continue and delete your branches as normal.<div><br></div>
