<div>​​​Assume you are creating a cool new feature. First you will create a new branch, create some commits, check it works, and submit a pull request. However, if you are not happy with the feature then don’t just delete the branch as normal. Instead, create a pull request anyway and set the status to Abandoned. Now, you can&#160;continue to delete your branch as normal.<br></div><div><br></div><div>This makes sure that we have a historical log of work​ completed, and still keeps a clean repository.<br><div><br></div></div>
