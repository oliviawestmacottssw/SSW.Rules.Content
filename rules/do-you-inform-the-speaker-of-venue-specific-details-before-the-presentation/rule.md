<p>Each venue is a little different and has different requirements. Don’t expect presenters to know how each user group runs, especially if the user group organisers will not be available on the day/night.</p><br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​​For example&#58;</p><h3>Sydney .Net User Group Presenter Information</h3><ol><li>Presenters will require a VGA or HDMI output or available adapter on their laptops </li></ol><h3>Canberra .Net User Group Presenter Information</h3><ol><li>Presenters will require a VGA output on their laptops, or an adapter for VGA</li><li>The Microsoft Canberra reception staff will not be available after 5pm so arrive at 4.45 and make sure that that you can get your laptop outputting connected to the projector correctly</li><li>Set up early and then wait to greet people at the front door until 5.30 pm, otherwise it is not clear that the user group is on</li></ol><br>
