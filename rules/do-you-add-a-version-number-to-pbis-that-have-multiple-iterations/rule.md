Sometimes your team will work on a PBI, finish it in the sprint, and receive​ feedback about changes or extensions that weren't originally asked for in the <a href="/do-your-user-stories-include-acceptance-criteria-(aka-never-assume-automatic-gold-plating)">Acceptance Criteria</a>.&#160;
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p><strong>​Bad Example&#58; </strong>Unlimited new tasks get added to that PBI so it takes multiple sprints to finish</p><p><strong>Good Example&#58; </strong>A new PBI is added to the backlog called &quot;&lt;original PBI name&gt; v2&quot;. If this then happens again, a v3 is created, and so on</p><p>This has the added bonus of allowing the <a href="/rules-to-better-product-owners">Product Owner</a> to see, at a glance,&#160;how many rounds of feedback he's given to the team on each PBI.</p>
