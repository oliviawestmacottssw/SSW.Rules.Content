<p>What is ANAME record? ANAME record is an alias record that allows you to map the apex record or any other record within your domain to a target host name, essentially a CNAME record for the apex record. ANAME record&#160;is&#160;especially useful&#160;for when you have multiple domain names and&#160;your website is hosted by a provider that&#160;changes it's IP Address, this does happen quite regularly with WPEngine.
