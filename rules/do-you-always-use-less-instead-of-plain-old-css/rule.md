<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Writing CSS is easy. Writing a lot of CSS can become unwieldy and unmanageable. Using CSS pre-processors like LESS or SCSS helps you segment and organize your CSS logically and compiles down to regular CSS so there are extra steps to get up and running.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>The key advantage of using CSS pre-processors is nested selectors. Instead line after line of specific CSS selectors you can nest them and they will compile down for you. Check out this example:​</p><dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="RulesLESS - css.png" alt="RulesLESS - css.png" /></dt><dd>Bad Example: Using regular CSS, you repeat yourself a lot</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="RulesLESS - less.png" alt="RulesLESS - less.png" /></dt><dd>Good Example: Using LESS, we can structure our CSS better<br></dd></dl><p>The pre-processed​ CSS then compiles to the regular CSS shown above.<br></p><p>We recommend using SCSS for its slightly more robust language scripting, however, the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/">differences between LESS and SCSS are minor</a>.<br><br></p>
