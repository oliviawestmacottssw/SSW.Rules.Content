<p>It's better to use links to a portal or document store instead of having attachments in your emails. </p>
<p>If you're sending to a fellow employee, use a link to a document store on your intranet (e.g. intranet.northwind.com/SharedDocuments) </p>
<p>If you're sending to a client, it would be a link to a document store on their <a href="/Management/RulesToHappyClients/Pages/DoYouUseAProjectPageForYourTeamAndClient.aspx">project portal</a>. (e.g. projects.northwind.com/SharedDocuments)</p>
