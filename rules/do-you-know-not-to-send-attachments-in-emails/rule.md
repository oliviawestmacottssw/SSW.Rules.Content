It's better to use links to a portal or document store instead of having attachments in your emails.

If you're sending to a fellow employee, use a link to a document store on your intranet (e.g. intranet.northwind.com/SharedDocuments)

If you're sending to a client, it would be a link to a document store on their [project portal](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=846474eb-27a1-4645-90ee-10a349fef714). (e.g. projects.northwind.com/SharedDocuments)

      <img alt="Forward client attachments" src="Email_Attachment_1_small.jpg">
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Bad example - Don't send attachments by mail </dd></dl><dl class="badImage">&lt;dt&gt;
      <img width="640" height="440" alt="PortalLinks.jpg" src="PortalLinks.jpg" style="height:410px;margin:5px;width:610px;">
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Bad example - Don't use location / filename in the link (URL)</dd></dl>
**Tip:** If you're using SharePoint, then an even better way to do this is to use a tool like OnePlaceMail to insert a link from SharePoint
<dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;
      <img alt="OnePlaceMail.png" src="insert_link_in_email_to_sharePoint_item-png.png">
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Good Example - Use OnePlaceMail to send a link to a document in SharePoint</dd></dl>
Using the Document ID Feature in SharePoint will help minimise broken links under the following scenarios:

1. Company Restructures / SharePoint restructures
2. Records Management – when items are moved to the Record Centre

<dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;<img alt="OnePlaceMail.png" src="insert_link_in_email_to_sharePoint_item_with_document_id-png.png">&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Good Example - The use of the SharePoint Document ID as part of the link (URL) formation</dd></dl>
If you are using a shared DropBox, then put in a reference like so:
