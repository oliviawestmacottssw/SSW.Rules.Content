<p>Extend opportunities to use our branded shirts. Cool shirts with small logos. No - not in the cattle branding style - but your employees are in effect, walking billboards. The corporate uniform should be stylish, and the branding can be subtle and effective at the same time. Branding employees is especially important at events such as conferences, user groups and client meetings. </p>
