<p>​​​It is the responsibility of Account Managers​ to book developers for known client work, however anyone can book a developer, including the developer themselves. Also if a developer notices they should be booked, but there's nothing in their calendar, and they can't figure out the below, as a minimum they should ask the Account Manager to book them.​<br></p><p>​To book a developer&#58;<br></p><p><strong>Prerequisite&#58;&#160;</strong><a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=31d6b133-8ed2-4ef4-b0b8-33bfebd85d10">Install the Dynamics Add-in​.​</a><br><br></p><dl class="image"><dt>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<h3>Option&#160;1&#58; Use the&#160;Outlook&#160;Calendar and &quot;Set Regarding&quot; (recommended)</h3><p>This is generally the easiest way for developers to book themselves in as they don't need to leave outlook and 90% of the steps will already be familiar to them.<br></p><ol><li>Create a new Outlook appointment and give it a relevant subject</li><li>Select required resources if there are other people working with you or if you're booking for someone else<br></li><ol><li>​​​​Note&#58; if you're booking for someone else, just have them in the To box of the appointment​. If you're booking yourself AND someone else, have both of you in the To box.</li></ol><li>Set the time and location for your appointment</li><li>Set the recurrence if it’s more than 1 day of work</li><li>Click &quot;Dynamics 365&quot; on the ribbon which will open a side panel and click on&#160;&quot;Set Regarding&quot;&#160;then search&#160;select the company that you want to book the developers to work on (this is the step that syncs it with CRM)</li></ol><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/Dynamics1.jpg" alt="Dynamics1.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;750px;height&#58;299px;" /> <br></dt><dd>Figure&#58; A complete appointment booking Brendan​​&#160;to work for SSW for 5 days<br></dd></dl><h3>​Option 2&#58; CRM Activity Appointments&#160;<br></h3><p>This is a backup&#160;option for anyone who doesn't have access to Outlook with the CRM add-in.<br></p><ol><li>Create new appointment from the Dynamics Online&#160;web interface<br></li></ol><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/PublishingImages/Dynamics-Calendar-App.jpg" alt="Dynamics-Calendar-App.jpg" style="color&#58;#333333;margin&#58;5px;width&#58;750px;height&#58;348px;" /><span style="color&#58;#555555;font-weight&#58;bold;">F</span><span style="color&#58;#555555;font-weight&#58;bold;">i</span><span style="color&#58;#555555;font-weight&#58;bold;">gure&#58; Click Appointment to create a new appointment in CRM</span><span style="color&#58;#555555;font-weight&#58;bold;"><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><span style="color&#58;#555555;font-weight&#58;bold;"><br></span></dl></span></dl><ol><li>Set the Subject</li><li>Select the resources that you want to book</li><li>Select the client that you want to book the developers to work on</li><li>Set the location</li><li>Set the Start and End times</li><li>If the booking is for more than 1 day, click “Recurrence” and set the frequency​<br></li></ol><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">Tip&#58; If you do not want the to block your calendar, you can change the orgainzer and owner to the developer you are booking. It will still track to the ​​Service Calendar, but wont add it to your personal calendar, only the developers.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/Dynamics-Appointment.jpg" alt="Dynamics-Appointment.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;750px;height&#58;367px;" /> <br></dt><dd>Figure&#58; A complete CRM Appointment for a 1-day booking<br></dd></dl><h3>Option&#160;3&#58; CRM Service&#160;Activities (bad example)</h3><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/CRMServiceActivity.jpg" alt="CRMServiceActivity.jpg" style="width&#58;95%;" /> </dt><dd> Figure&#58; Bad Example - Don't use Service Activities as they don't map as gracefully with Outlook Appointments</dd></dl><p>If you do not know who can do the work, but you know the type of resource required, you can use Service Activities.</p> 
<p>The downside of Service Activities is that they do not sync gracefully with outlook calendars.</p><p>Back in CRM4, the only way to make recurring appointments was to use Service activities, but this is no longer the case so Service Activities are not recommended for resource scheduling if you know who you want to schedule.</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">(for options&#160;1 and 2) Adding Tentative Bookings</h3><p>Sometimes you may want to reserve a consultant for an appointment but are not able to confirm with the client immediately. In this case,&#160;create a Tentative Booking which reserves the consultant for the period of the booking without assigning t​​h​em to the client account. The purpose of a&#160;Tentative Booking&#160;is to reserve a&#160;consultant&#160;and trigger a conversation between Account Ma​nagers if the consultant is required on confirmed client work&#160;over the same period.<br></p><p>To create a Tentative Booking&#58;</p><ol><li>Follow the same steps above to create the Appointment​<br></li><li>Instead of choosing a client account for 'Set Regarding', choose the company (E.g.&#160;&quot;ssw.pencilledin&quot;).</li></ol><p><b>Tip&#58;</b> Create a &quot;Booked In Days&quot;&#160;Report and make the Tentative Bookings display obviously (E.g. A&#160;grey&#160;color), so Account Managers&#160;can&#160;easily see it​​&#160;if they&#160;need to use that time.​<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">(for options 1 and 2) Adding Internal Bookings<br></h3><p>If a developer is needed for non-billable work (E.g. Urgent internal work), or travelling to teach public training events, their time should be blocked out so it shows as unavailable for client work.<br></p><p>To book someone for internal work&#58;<br></p><ol><li>​​<span style="background-color&#58;initial;color&#58;#444444;">​​Follow the same steps as above to create the Appointment</span><br></li><li><span style="background-color&#58;initial;color&#58;#444444;">Instead of choosing a client account for &quot;Set Regarding&quot;, choose your own company (E.g.&#160;&quot;SSW&quot;).</span></li></ol><div><img src="/SiteAssets/scheduling-do-you-know-how-to-book-developers-for-a-project/2020-03-20_10-49-19.png" alt="2020-03-20_10-49-19.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /><br><strong>Figure&#58; Internally&#160;Booked days show as&#160;black and Pencilled In days&#160;show as&#160;grey​​​​</strong><br></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Using a Sub-Folder to book appointments<br></h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​If you have a lot of staff, it can&#160;be useful to use a sub-folder to make your bookings to stop them from covering your&#160;every day calendar making it hard to read.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"> Unfortunately, you cannot use a sub-folder to track appointments in Outlook.
