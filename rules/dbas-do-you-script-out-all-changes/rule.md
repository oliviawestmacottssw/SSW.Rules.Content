<p>​Every time a change is made to your product's SQL Server Database, script out the change. You can use Enterprise Manager, VS.NET or Query Analyzer but every time you make changes you must save the change as a .sql script file so any alterations are scripted. Everything at SSW is usually done three times, once on Development, once on Staging and once on Production. Change control is one of the most important processes to ensuring a stable database system.<br></p><p>Keep the scripts in a separate directory to any other scripts or files. This way you can always go back to them and find out what alterations you have made to the database in version xxx to find errors. If you have all the scripts you are able to rebuild the database from scratch. At SSW we name this folder SQLChangeScripts so as to not confuse it with other script folders.​​<br></p>

The folder it is kept in is called &quot;Auto-Generated Stored Procedures&quot;.​​<br></p><p>The scripts found within this folder are as follows&#58;<br></p><ul><li>010_ViewsForStoredProcedures.sql</li><li>020_StoredProcedures_Select.sql</li><li>030_StoredProcedures_Insert.sql</li><li>040_StoredProcedures_Update.sql</li><li>050_StoredProcedures_Delete.sql</li></ul><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">After re-generation of code in the solution, these scripts will be updated with the required stored procs for new Database Objects found in the application. The problem is, however, that every time a re-generation occurs these files must always be added to the large list of scripts in the &quot;SQLChangeScripts&quot; folder as shown above.​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">To solve the issue of continually piling up these scripts every time you use&#160;Next Generation&#160;, it is recommended that the scripts are copied over to the &quot;SQLChangeScripts&quot; folder, and the names should not be changed.​<br></p>By only modifying the first three numbers accordingly for the correct script sequence, you will be able to find all other Next Generation stored procs, as shown in the figure below.<br>
