This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).

<p>Here's a couple of solutions&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanently delete your deleted items. This is based on the theory that once you have deleted a mail item, you should NEVER HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN. This is a good theory, but unfortunately we don't always follow it in practice and there's no recovery 
<li>
<table align="right">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<dl class="goodImage">
<dt><img style="border-bottom&#58;1px solid;border-left&#58;1px solid;border-top&#58;1px solid;border-right&#58;1px solid;" border="1" alt="Outlook Deleted Items Subfolders" src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/OulookDeletedItemsSubFolders.gif" /> 
<dd>Figure&#58; Deleted Items</dd></dl></td></tr></tbody></table>Move the items into subfolders under Deleted Items. This is a good solution as you can manually archive items, making it easier to search. You can permanently delete items when they reach a certain age. </li></ul>
<p>NOTE&#58; A hot tip for making it easy to search for an accidentally deleted item is to add the &quot;Modified&quot; field into your Deleted Items view and sort by &quot;Modified&quot;. The item from two months ago which you just accidentally deleted will be sitting at the top.</p>
