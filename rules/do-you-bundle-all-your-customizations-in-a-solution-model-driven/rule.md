<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">When customizing a Model-Driven App all changes should be in a solution. A solution holds all customization being carried out by the maker, whether it be any custom entities, processes, business rules, or modifications to existing OOTB entities.​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​Solutions can be used to move these customizations between environments, eg. from development à testing à production.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Solutions can also be used to deploy changes in a managed (testing, production) and unmanaged (development) environment. Managed solutions can be thought of in simple terms and an installer can be installed and uninstalled.</p><p>Differences between Managed and Unmanaged solutions&#58;</p><ul><li>When a Managed solution is uninstalled, all artifacts including data are removed​<br></li><li>Unmanaged solutions will install the changes but deleting the solution will leave the changes intact, so think of it as an additive change</li><li>To completely remove all customizations in an Unmanaged solution every customized item needs to be manually deleted</li></ul><dl class="image"><dt>
