Instructions are&#160;very important when maintaining a project. With this document, people new to it can take over it quickly. This document should be created at the beginning of a project and make sure it's updated gradually. ​​
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>We recommend that you add a document as a solution item and name it '_Instructions.docx'. 
   <br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Reference">​​​Tip&#58; Microsoft Word documents are preferred over .txt files because images and formatting are important<br></p><p>You can also break up this document into 4 smaller documents</p><ul><li>_Business.docx - Explaining the business purpose of the app</li><li>_Instructions_Compile.docx - Contains instructions on how to get the project to compile</li><li>_Instructions_Deployment.docx - Describes the deployment process</li><li>_Technologies.docx - Explaining the technical overview e.g. Broad architecture decisions, 3rd party utilities, patterns followed etc</li></ul><p>Here's a suggestion of what these documents could contain. They are not compulsory but may be necessary for running the project. </p><ol><li>Project structure 
      <p>All parts that composes the project and how they work with each other.</p></li><li>Third party components 
      <p>Any software, tools and DLL files that this project uses. (e.g., NHibernate, ComponentArt)</p></li><li>Database configuration </li><li>Other configuration information</li><li>FTP information and Deployment procedure </li><li>Other things to take care of </li></ol><dl class="badImage"><dt>

      <img alt="Good Solutions Have Instructions - Level 1" src="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterDotNETProjects/PublishingImages/instructions-level1.jpg" />
   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Level 1 documentation is static word documents. The _instructions_compile.docx contains the steps required to be able to get latest and compile</dd></dl><h2>Level 2&#58; Can you get latest and compile with the database </h2><dl class="image"><dt>
      <img alt="Good Solutions Have Instructions - level 2" src="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterDotNETProjects/PublishingImages/instructions-level2.jpg" />
   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Level 2 Documentation includes database build scripts. We use 
      <a target="_blank" href="http&#58;//sqldeploy.com/">SSW SQL Deploy</a>&#160;to make keeping all databases on the same version simple. Check out 
      <a target="_blank" href="http&#58;//tv.ssw.com/969/adam-stephensen-sql-deploy-demo">how to use SQL Deploy here​</a></dd></dl><h2>Level 3&#58; Can you get latest and compile  with a Powershell script</h2><p>A perfect solution would need no static documentation. Perfect code would be so self-explanatory that it did not need comments. The same rule applies with instructions on how to get the solution compiling&#58; the best answer would be for the solution to contain scripts that automates the setup.</p><h2>Example of Level 3&#58; Powershell Documentation</h2><p>
   <strong>Recommendation&#58;</strong> All manual work station setup steps should be scripted with powershell (as per the below example)</p><p>
   <strong>Recommendation&#58;</strong> You should be able to get latest and compile within 1 minute. Also, a developer machine should not HAVE to be on the domain (to support external consultants)</p><div class="ssw-rteStyle-GreyBox">PS C&#58;\Code\Northwind&gt;<strong> .\Setup-Environment.ps1</strong><br><br>Problem&#58; Azure environment variable run state directory is not configured (_CSRUN_STATE_DIRECTORY).<br>&#160;<br>Problem&#58; Azure Storage Service is not running.
