​Instructions are&#160;very important when maintaining a project. With this document, people new to it can take over it quickly. This document should be created at the beginning of a project and make sure it's updated gradually. ​​<br><div><br></div>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>We recommend&#58;</p><ul><li>Add a document as a solution item and name it '_Instructions.docx'<br></li><li>Add a readme.md to your solution (Use&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/reference/markdown-guidance">this​</a>&#160;as a guidance for markdown)<br><br></li></ul><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Reference">Tip&#58; Microsoft Word documents are preferred over .txt files because images and formatting are important<br></p><p>You can also break up this document into 4 smaller documents</p><ul><li>_Business.docx - Explaining the business purpose of the app</li><li>_Instructions_Compile.docx - Contains instructions on how to get the project to compile<br></li><li>_Instructions_Deployment.docx - Describes the deployment process</li><li>_Technologies.docx - Explaining the technical overview e.g. Broad architecture decisions, 3rd party utilities, patterns followed etc</li></ul><p>Here's a suggestion of what these documents could contain. They are not compulsory but may be necessary for running the project.</p><ol><li>Project structure<p>All parts that composes the project and how they work with each other.</p></li><li>Third party components<p>Any software, tools and DLL files that this project uses. (e.g., NHibernate, ComponentArt)</p></li><li>Database configuration</li><li>Other configuration information</li><li>Deployment information and&#160;procedures <br></li><li>Other things to take care of</li></ol><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/BadNetProject.JPG" alt="A project with an instructions" /> </dt><dd>Bad example - A project without an instructions. </dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img alt="Good Solutions Have Instructions" src="/PublishingImages/ProjectDocumentation.jpg" /> </dt><dd>Good example - A project with instruction </dd></dl><p>When a new developer starts on a project you want them to get up and running as soon as possible.</p><p>Problems to check for&#58;</p><ul><li>Windows 8 not supported</li><li>Many things to build</li><li>Lots of dependencies</li></ul><p>It is essential to have documentation that describes what is required to configure a developer workstation.</p><p>There are 3 Levels of this documentation in a project.</p><h2>Level 1&#58; Can you get latest and compile with a Docx</h2><dl class="image"><dt> <img alt="Good Solutions Have Instructions - Level 1" src="/PublishingImages/instructions-level1.jpg" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Level 1 documentation is static word documents. The _instructions_compile.docx contains the steps required to be able to get latest and compile</dd></dl><h2>Level 2&#58; Can you get latest and compile with the database</h2><dl class="image"><dt> <img alt="Good Solutions Have Instructions - level 2" src="/PublishingImages/instructions-level2.jpg" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Level 2 Documentation includes database build scripts. We use <a target="_blank" href="http&#58;//sqldeploy.com/">SSW SQL Deploy</a>&#160;to make keeping all databases on the same version simple. Check out <a target="_blank" href="http&#58;//tv.ssw.com/969/adam-stephensen-sql-deploy-demo">how to use SQL Deploy here </a></dd></dl><h2>Level 3&#58; Can you get latest and compile with a PowerShell script</h2><p>A perfect solution would need no static documentation. Perfect code would be so self-explanatory that it did not need comments. The same rule applies with instructions on how to get the solution compiling&#58; the best answer would be for the solution to contain scripts that automate&#160;the setup.</p><div style="margin&#58;0px 0px 0px 40px;border&#58;none;padding&#58;0px;"><h2>Example of Level 3&#58; PowerShell Documentation<br></h2><p>
      <strong>Recommendation&#58;</strong> All manual workstation setup steps should be scripted with powerShell (as per the below example)</p><p>
      <strong>Recommendation&#58;</strong> You should be able to get latest and compile within 1 minute. Also, a developer machine should not HAVE to be on the domain (to support external consultants)<br></p><div class="ssw-rteStyle-GreyBox">PS C&#58;\Code\Northwind&gt;<strong> .\Setup-Environment.ps1</strong><br><br>Problem&#58; Azure environment variable run state directory is not configured (_CSRUN_STATE_DIRECTORY).<br>&#160;<br>Problem&#58; Azure Storage Service is not running.
