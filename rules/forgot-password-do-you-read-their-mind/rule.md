<p>
                    Unfortunately here is the normal routine to get an email 
     with your password.
                </p><ol><li>You go to a Login form, enter your email and password, 
     and click the 'Login' button.</li><li>You get a validation message like 'Incorrect Password'.</li><li>Then you have to click a 'Forgot Password' link to go to 
     another 'Get Password' form, and then they almost always ask 
     you to enter your email again and then click 'Get Password' 
     button.</li></ol>

<strong>The goal should be&#58;</strong> 
<p> Be more efficient and user-friendly and save them a step. Please DO NOT bother users to do any more redundant work. </p><p> Instead enter their email when they click 'Forgot Password' link. </p>
