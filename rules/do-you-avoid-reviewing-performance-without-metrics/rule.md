  <p>If a client says&#58;</p>
<div class="greyBox">
<em>&quot;This application is too slow, I don't really want to put up with such poor performance. Please fix.&quot;</em></div>
<p>We don't jump in and look at the code and clean it up and reply with something like&#58;</p>
<div class="greyBox">&quot;I've looked at the code and cleaned it up - not sure if this is suitable - please tell me if you are OK with the performance now.&quot;</div>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>A better way is&#58;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask the client to tell us how slow it is (in seconds) and how fast they ideally would like it (in seconds)
    </li>
    <li>Add some code to record the time the function takes to run
    </li>
    <li>Reproduce the steps and record the time
    </li>
    <li>Change the code
    </li>
    <li>Reproduce the steps and record the time again
    </li>
    <li>Reply to the customer&#58;<br> &quot;It was 22 seconds, you asked for around 10 seconds. It is now 8 seconds.&quot;<br></li>
</ul>

<p>This is because performance is an emotional thing, sometimes it just *feels* slower. Without numbers, a person cannot really know for sure whether something has become quicker. </p>
