How often has the connection dropped out while a call center operator was trying to transfer you, or perhaps you get put straight through to someone's voicemail, meaning you need to hang up and call again. You should have a simple method for transferring calls that ensures the caller doesn't go around in circles or is left waiting for ages, wondering what is going on.&#160; <br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ul><li>When a caller asks to be transferred say &quot;Just putting you through&quot; (Instead of &quot;Hang on&quot; which doesn't give the caller any indication of what is going on).<br></li><li>IM e.g. Stephen&#58; &quot;Stephen, Colin from Microsoft Events, Line 1.&quot;</li><li>Stephen responds &quot;OK&quot;, and then pick up the call, following the rule above</li><li>If Stephen doesn't respond or messages &quot;Busy&quot;, Stephen is with a client or away from his desk. Then ask is there anything I can help you with?&#160; Take a message or try and assist the caller yourself</li></ul><p>More on&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=74c43cf5-36a0-4cde-bea2-f9aa7f3b7b59">Rules to Better Instant Messenger</a>.<br></p>
