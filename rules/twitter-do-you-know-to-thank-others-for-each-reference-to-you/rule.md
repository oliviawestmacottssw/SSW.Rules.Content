<p>​When others mention you on their blog or podcast and if they re-tweet you then you should always thank them&#58;</p><blockquote><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">@<a href="http&#58;//twitter.com/briankel" shape="rect">briankel</a> said something nice about me in his 100th This Week On Channel 9 episode 
      <a href="https&#58;//bit.ly/cPD0vg" shape="rect">https&#58;//bit.ly/cPD0vg</a> &#58;) Thanks Brian...

      <strong>Figure&#58; Good example, always thanking someone is not just good practice and polite, you both get Google juice as well.<br><br> </strong></p></blockquote><p>Remember to say something constructive and not just &quot;thanks&quot;.</p> ​​​
