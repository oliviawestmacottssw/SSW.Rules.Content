  <p>A task should never have an estimate of more than a day (8 hours). </p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>If you have a big task with an estimate of more the 4 hours, you should consider breaking it in sub-tasks. In case the estimate has changed during the sprint, the “Remaining Hours” field must be update in order to have an accurate Burndown chart.</p>
<p>The reason scrum limits the maximum hours is because you should always know in which task you are working and we believe one single action that takes more than 4 hours might be too generic. Refer to&#160;<a shape="rect" href="/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/TaskUnderFourHours.aspx">Do you create tasks under 4 hours?</a>&#160;to know more.</p>
