​​​​​​​​Sometimes the photo you want to share is not ideal to include texts and/or your logo.&#160;Adding&#160;overlays&#160;on these images creates&#160;a professional look to any photo, helps to hide messy desks or floors if needed, and it gives it a consistent contrast and feel&#160;to the post.&#160;<div><br></div><div>It’s a good way of adding text to a photo as well following your branding guidelines at the same time.<br></div>
