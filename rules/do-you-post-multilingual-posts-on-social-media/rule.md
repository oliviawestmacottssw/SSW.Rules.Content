<div>If you have an office in more than one country, a great way to show your diversity.&#160;Though building and maintaining a multilingual social media presence is not an easy undertaking, when done properly it is well worth the time and effort. It allows you to truly connect with your audience regardless of which language they speak. International customers will appreciate the fact that your brand has taken time to communicate with them in their native tongue, and they don't have to rely on dodgy automatic translations which could go wrong.<br>&#160;<br></div>
