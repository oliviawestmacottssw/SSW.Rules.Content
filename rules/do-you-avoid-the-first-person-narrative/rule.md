​When writing for an audience, you want to make sure you're consistent in your way&#160;of addressing them. For standards and rules, it's best to explain what they should do from an objective standpoint.<br>
If you want to use an example from your company to explain how something is done, you should avoid speaking from the 1st person (i.e. I or we) or 2nd person (i.e. you or your). Use 3rd person, like Wikipedia.<br>
