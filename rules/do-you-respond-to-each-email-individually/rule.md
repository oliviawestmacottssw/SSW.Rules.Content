  <p>(AKA - don't respond to a series of emails in one email) If you receive separate emails, respond to each email individually. Don't answer a few emails in one email.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each email is a little job (eating the elephant one bit at a time)
    </li>
    <li>You get a steady flow back as bits are achieved (can get a feel or monitor employees efficiency)
    </li>
    <li>You can move to 'todo' list folders
    </li>
    <li>You get a email history for that one topic </li>
</ul>
