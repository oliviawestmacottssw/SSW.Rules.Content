Facebook has a call-to-action feature that helps Pages drive business objectives. These call-to-action buttons link to any destination on or off Facebook that aligns with a business’s goals.

Page admins can select from a group of call-to-action buttons:



- Book Now
- Contact Us
- Use App
- Play Game
- Shop Now
- Sign Up
- Watch Video



 
​​For services or apps, you should use the "Watch Video" one. Video is flooding the online marketplace and is quickly becoming a marketing standard to convey your message.​ ​If you don't have a video yet, visit <br>      [SSW's Video Services pages](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Video-Production/) to make a creative and engaging ​video for your company.
