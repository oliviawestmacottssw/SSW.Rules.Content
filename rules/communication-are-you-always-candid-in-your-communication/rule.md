It is extremely important to maintain honesty and candor in a team environment. Sometimes this means admitting when you're uncertain and not just communicating wishful thinking.

Nothing breaks down a team like a lack of trust. Remember, honesty starts with the small things.

<!--endintro-->

You also need to make sure you qualify your level of certainty in an answer, so that your guess (which could be wrong) does not end up misleading someone.

e.g. "Is the database corrupt?"

Bad example: No.

Good Example: I don't think so but I'd need investigate further to be sure.
