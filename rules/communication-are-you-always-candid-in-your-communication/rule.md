<p>You also need to make sure you qualify​ your level of certainty in an answer, so that your guess (which could be wrong) does not end&#160;up misleading someone.</p><p>e.g.&#160;<span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">&quot;Is the database corrupt?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Bad example&#58; No.</span></p><p><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Good Example&#58; I don't think so but I'd need investigate further to be sure.</span></p>
