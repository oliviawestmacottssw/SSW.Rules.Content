In a piece of writing, both “NB” and “Note” can be used to add a piece of information or attract the reader’s attention to an important detail. Of these 2 options, it is better to use “Note” than to use “NB”.&#160;<br><br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​This is because NB is old-fashioned – it is the abbreviation for “nota bene”, Latin for “note well” –&#160;and its meaning is not immediately clearm, whereas&#160;the meaning of “note” is immediately obvious.&#160;It is always better to use&#160;plain English, and to avoid&#160;abbreviations that could be confused for something else. Therefore, you should use “note” in your documentation to ensure your meaning is clear.&#160;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><strong>NB&#58; </strong>It is important to track how long this process runs for.​​​<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Bad example&#58; NB is unclear and old-fashioned<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><strong>​​Not​​e&#58; </strong>It is important to track how long this process runs for.<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​​&#160;​Good example&#58; It is obvious what we mean when we use &quot;Note&quot;<br></dd>
