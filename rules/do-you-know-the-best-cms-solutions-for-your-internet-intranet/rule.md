  <p>You donâ€™t want to building solutions from scratch, take the business value you can, from a CMS and a CRM. Don't reinvent the wheel.<br>
<br>
The main choices are&#58; </p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http&#58;//www.dotnetnuke.com/" class="external" target="_blank">www.DotNetNuke.com</a> </li>
    <li><a href="http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/office/preview/servers/sharepointserver/highlights.mspx" class="external">Microsoft Sharepoint 2007</a> </li>
    <li><a class="external" target="_blank">www.CommunityServer.org</a> </li>
    <li>Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 hand coded pages </li>
</ul>
<p>There are pros and cons to all and it depends on what functionality/customization you need but we lean towards DotNetNuke and Sharepoint for most solutions.<br>
