Most people will be accessing your website from their mobile phone, so it’s really important to have a layout that allows them to read or to see your content properly if they are not accessing it from a desktop. Websites that mobile users can easily use may also have an edge in Google’s “Mobile-first Index”. This <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly">free tool </a>from Google will help you check if your website is mobile friendly, and if not, it will recommend what you can do to fix it.<br>
