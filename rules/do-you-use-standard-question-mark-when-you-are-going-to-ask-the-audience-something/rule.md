 In a similar fashion to the [Do you remind yourself to do a demo?](/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/Pages/DemoSlide.aspx) rule, you can also add a visual cue for any audience participation you would like, such as questions or voting.  ![](/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/PublishingImages/SSWQuestionMark.gif) Figure: Use an "?" image to tell the presenter to ask a question (if you don't have an image - just use the "?" text)
