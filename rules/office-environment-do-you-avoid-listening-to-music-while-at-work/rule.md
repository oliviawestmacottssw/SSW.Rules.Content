<p>​​Should we be listening to music                    at work? I've had the debate&#160;with numerous people.

<p>Regardless of whether it is AC/DC or DotNetRocks, music/podcasts should not be used in the workplace, especially using headphones, because&#58;</p><ul><li>I want my team to work with each other, and I don't mind that they hear other conversations going on.
