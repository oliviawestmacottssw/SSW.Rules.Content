<p><span style="color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;verdana, sans-serif;font-size&#58;12px;line-height&#58;16.8px;">Many websites use JavaScript for fancy menus, dropdowns or scroll overs. However, sometimes search engines can't read JavaScript in all of our pages. It's known that Google can index some content inside JavaScript, but the really important content should be placed in normal HTML so that you know it will be indexed. This keeps the code clean and helps search engines index pages.</span>â€‹</p>
