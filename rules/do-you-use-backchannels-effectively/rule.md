<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Often, when a manager is called in to help out with a conflict situation, they don’t have all the context or details, so backchannels can help to fill the gap.​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p><b>Prior backchannels</b> - Have an &quot;off the record&quot; conversation with your manager or teammate before a client meeting. If your manager has no idea about an issue, when they’re put on the&#160;spot in a meeting, they then have to interrogate regarding processes followed, etc. It’s better to have them prepared before they go in.<br></p><p><b>Live&#160;backchannels </b>-&#160;Assist in real-time with relevant information in an alternative private channel e.g. SMS or Teams. This can help the conversation flow and help to verify what is being said, and limits the need for phrases such as, “William, is that true?”</p><p><b>Post&#160;backchannels&#160;</b>– Debrief your manager or teammate how the call or situation was handled, outcomes, where it is at now, next steps, etc.<br><br>In general, use Teams for private information, or SMS&#160;as a last resort. Treat sensitive information or scenarios with care to ensure a good outcome for all parties.​<br><br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><b>Client&#58;</b> &quot;I told them we’d need blah&quot;<br><b>Manager&#58;</b> &quot;Oh that does sound reasonable. Devs, why was that missed?&quot;</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example&#58; Manager looks uninformed and is always on the back foot, and needing to ask questions that everyone else in the call on both sides already knows<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><b>Client&#58;</b> &quot;I told them we’d need blah.&quot;<br><b>Dev (on a private channel with Manager)&#58;</b> &quot;That’s true, but it only came up after the 1st sprint was already done.&quot;<br><b>Manager&#58;</b> &quot;My understanding was that was only asked for after the 1st sprint.&quot;<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example&#58; Manager is armed with relevant information as needed<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><b>Dev&#58;</b> &quot;Heads up, they might be sensitive about this part as they have been very clear with us about it from the start and I missed it. This part was really my fault.&quot;<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example&#58; Let the Manager know what parts are reasonable to push, and what battles are better surrendered<br></dd>
