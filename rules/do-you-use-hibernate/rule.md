<p>​Hibernate is a power-saving state designed primarily for laptops, and might not be available for all PCs​​. Hibernation is a state in which the Win​dows PC saves the current state and shuts itself down so that it no longer needs power. When the PC is turned on again, all open files and programs are restored to the same state as they were before hibernation. Windows 10 by default does not include the Hibernate option under the power menu, but there’s an easy way to enable it. Here’s how to make Windows show Hibernate alongside Shut Down in Power menu.</p><span style="line-height:1.6;">To enable the Hibernate option in </span>Windows 10<span style="line-height:1.6;">, make sure that your system hardware supports hibernation and then follow the steps below to enable it.
