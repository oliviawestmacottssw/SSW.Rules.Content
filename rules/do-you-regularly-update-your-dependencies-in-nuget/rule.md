<p>ASP.NET MVC makes good use of NuGet for managing its dependencies, however these dependencies can easily get out of date.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>When you begin a new MVC project, there are often many dependencies that already have updated versions.</p>
<p>You should immediately update your NuGet dependencies in the NuGet Package Manager after starting an MVC project. You should also frequently check for new updates during development so youâ€™re not working with out of date versions. </p>
