How you present the product information depends on the sort of application you are                 developing.
 
- *If the application is wizard application:*The first page of the utility should introduce the user to the application.
    Because the first two paragraphs of this screen and the first few paragraphs of the application's website often contain virtually identical information (i.e., describing the product) it may be a good idea to make both the same. The first two paragraphs of the screen can be copied from portions of the website.
    A "More" hyperlink can also be added at the bottom of the screen, which will direct the user to the website where they can read further information about the application.

- *If the application is not a wizard application*
 The main menu of the application should have a Help - About... menu item. When clicked, a new form should open up containing similar information as the page in the wizard application described above.
