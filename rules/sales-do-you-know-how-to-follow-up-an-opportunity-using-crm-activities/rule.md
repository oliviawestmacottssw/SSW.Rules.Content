<p>Once you create an opportunity, you should click the &quot;Follow Up&quot; button to
          create an activity to call up the client after approximately 1 week. Each time you
          make this call, you should complete the&#160;activity and create a new one, with a time
          interval based on the specific circumstances of the opportunity.</p>

          You can see your outstanding activities in your CRM workspace homepage, and this
          should keep you on top of all of your current opportunities.</p><p><br>
          Make sure you never have an opportunity in CRM without a follow up activity against
          it; otherwise you're just hoping that they will remember to call you, which is&#160;never a good
          sales strategy.
        <br><br>The alternative to CRM activities is to use <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/FollowUpEmailsEffectively.aspx">FollowUpThen</a> instead. This is more convenient but is not centralised, meaning that&#160;â€‹when a salesperson leaves an organisation, their opportunities will need to be handed over manually.</p>
