​​If you’re building a website today, and your business needs to create addresses for different online directories, it can be hard to figure out the best way to go about it. <br><br>There’s a lot of debate about this topic on the internet, so the question to ask yourself is: “Should I use subdirectories or subdomains?”<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea">​<img src="rulesubdomains.png" alt="rulesubdomains.png" style="margin:5px;" /><strong>Figure: Difference between subdirectories and subdomains​</strong><br></dl><p><br></p><p>The general consensus ​is that if you are starting from scratch, it’s better to use subdirectories as they’re easier to maintain and less time-consuming in the long-term. However, if you already have a domain and a lot of legacy structures in place, using subdirectories could be a big change and might not be worth it. You would need to update your properties in Google Analytics, your Google Search Console settings, a lot of redirects, and much more.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Keep in mind, Google is now s​​mart enough to work this out for you – it's just an extra step for Google’s bots.
