When you notice that someone has done something that could haveÂ been done better, make sure you are tactful in your correction/suggestions. When you are giving someone a correction or tip, try to include an URL to back up your point.

For example, if someone sends you an email like that:

      <br>Hi Mary,<br> 
      <br>I noticed you did not send an appointment for this meeting. I hope you don't mind, but I have gone ahead and created one so we don't all have to create one individually. <br>We have a number of helpful standards like this which you can have a look at in our <a href="/appointments-do-you-send-outlook-calendar-appointments-when-appropriate">Rules to better Email</a> if you're interested.</p><br><br>::: good<br>Figure&#58; Good Example <br><br>:::<br><br></dl>
