<p>When you notice that someone has done something against our standards, make sure
                    you are tactful in your corrections; especially if the person you are correcting
                    is a client.

                        FYI - an appointment would have been better. See rule #48 in <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=35452dab-3ce2-469d-8642-9e64eaa6b6f6">

                        <br>
                        I noticed you did not send an appointment for this meeting. I hope you don't mind,
                        but I have gone ahead and created one so we don't all have to create one individually.
                        <br>
