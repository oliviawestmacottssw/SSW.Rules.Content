<p>​The word “integrity” can be loaded with ethical connotations, so let me define my meaning&#58;</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p class="p1">​Integrity is&#58;</p><ol class="ol1"><li class="li2"> 
      <strong>Being true to your word</strong> 
      <ol style="list-style-type&#58;lower-alpha;"><li>This means doing what you say you’d​&#160;do, by the time you said you’d do it</li></ol></li><li> 
      <strong>If you can’t deliver on your promise, have a plan for a path forward</strong> 
      <ol style="list-style-type&#58;lower-alpha;"><li>If you can’t get the agreed task done by the deadline, tell the person why and set a new deadline, or agree on a different deliverable.&#160;</li><li class="li2">Never leave them guessing</li></ol></li><li class="li2"> 
      <strong>If you break your word, acknowledge it, and work out a way to repair your integrity</strong> 
      <ol style="list-style-type&#58;lower-alpha;">
         <li>​Recognise the fault and propose a plan for how to do better next time</li></ol></li></ol><p>People who have integrity&#58;</p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li2">Always take full ownership of any task given to them</li><li class="li2">Inspire trust in co-workers and bosses</li><li class="li2">Hold themselves to a high professional standard</li></ul><p class="p1">Bosses with employees who have integrity&#58;</p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li2">Trust their employees</li><li class="li2">Are comfortable delegating more important work</li></ul>
