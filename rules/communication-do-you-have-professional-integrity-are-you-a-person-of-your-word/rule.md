<p>​When most people say they'll do something, they really mean they'll <strong>try</strong> to do it, and they don't really worry too much whether they are successful or not, so long as they gave their best effort.&#160;<br></p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify"><iframe width="750" height="422" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/aVgnaAOwBXk" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><p><br></p><p>This has a hidden cost, since&#160;if you commit to someone and fail repeatedly, even though they may know you're doing your best, they will nevertheless lose trust&#160;in your integrity, and the next time you commit, they will not really&#160;believe that you will follow through.<br>​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">Bob joins a Teams call 10 minutes late.
