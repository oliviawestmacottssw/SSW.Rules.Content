The way you and all members of your team present themselves is a crucial part of creating a good impression for your clients, particularly in their first encounters with you.
 
### Dressing Up

One aspect of this is the dress code. Dress code is important for two reasons:

- Looking professional and keen for business
- Reinforce the company's [branding](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=f6b90f42-7f48-4c44-b766-295de647bb47)


### Public Events and Meetings


Of course, when in a public event such as a User Group, conference or seeing clients you should "Dress Up".​

It should go without saying, but of course, things such as shaving off your weekend facial growth, using deodorant and having clean teeth and nice breath is assumed.

### On a business flight

It's a good idea to "Dress Up" in flights as you never know who you will be seated next to.  ![dresscode-linkedin.PNG](/PublishingImages/dresscode-linkedin.PNG)Figure: Why dress up in a flight

### Dressing Down (aka Casual Fridays)

Many companies find it a good idea to have Casual Fridays. It is free and easy to do and gives the team something to look forward to.

E.g. At SSW, our employees **"Dress Up"** on Mondays and Tuesdays by wearing company colors, with a nice shirt (business or polo), trousers (not blue jeans), belt, nice shoes (no sneakers, joggers or thongs). So most employees wear their SSW shirts on Mondays.
Then they **"Dress Down"** later in the week... so they have     **"Casual Thursday"** and     **"Sporty Friday"**.

Thursday are casual clothes. On Fridays, they encourage sport clothes, such as shorts. It allows the end of the week to be fun.
