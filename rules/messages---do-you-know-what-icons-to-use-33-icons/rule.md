#### Icon

Including an icon is important because not only does it give the user a visual indication of the type of message, but without it only the Default beep sound is used. The icon should reflect the type of information being presented:
   ​

| Icon | Name | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![info](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Info.gif) | **MessageBoxIcon.Information** | Non-error information, e.g. Database connection test completed successfully |
| ![Warning](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Warning.gif) | **MessageBoxIcon.Warning** | A non-critical error, e.g. The input was invalid |
| ![error](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Error.gif) | **MessageBoxIcon.Error** | Critical error in the program, e.g. Program file was not found |
| ![](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Question.gif) | **MessageBoxIcon.Question** | **NEVER** use this.  <br>According to Microsoft, the Question mark is being phased out, as any of the other three: Error, Warning or Information can easily be reworded into a Question, and Question does not show the user the severity of the issue that has just occurred.<br>E.g.  If you want to ask the user whether they want to save a file before closing, you should use the Warning Icon.  |



We have a program called [SSW Code](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#TitleVB)Auditorto check for this rule.
