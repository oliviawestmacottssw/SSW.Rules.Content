  <p>Most teams are getting the hang of User Stories that have sub tasks. Unfortunately the same can’t be said about acceptance criteria. <br>
It is so important because real user stories tell a team when the task is done.</p>
<p>Also Product Owners should not get heartburn because ‘obvious’ functionality was not included. All requirements should be specified in the Acceptance Criteria.<br>
For example, Product Owners should not assume things like&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>they will get a message that says ‘no records found’ or </li>
    <li>the grid will support features such as pagination or sorting </li>
</ul>
<p>They must be specified in the Acceptance Criteria if required.</p>
<p>There are 2 parts to getting this right. The Acceptance Criteria, then the Acceptance Tests&#58;</p>

<p> 
   <strong>Acceptance Criteria </strong>(from the Product Owner) define the exact requirements that must be met for the story to be completed. They answer the question, &quot;How will I know when I’m done with the story?&quot;</p><dl class="image"><dt>
