<p>Microsoft lists several recommended and supported network configurations. It is very important that you configure your Hyper-V Cluster with one of the supported network types otherwise you will have performance issues once you load up the cluster.</p>

<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Check you have one of the supported configurations listed on the <a href="http&#58;//technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428137%28WS.10%29.aspx">&gt;Microsoft Hyper-V Live Migration â€“ Network Configuration</a> page (this example has 3 networks)</span>
<p>It may work fine initially on a non-supported configuration but when you start loading more Virtual Machines on to the cluster the performance will be degrade dramatically.</p>
