<p>A few years ago, PageRank was the best way to&#160;track the relevance of a website. However, in&#160;2009, Google&#160;had removed PageRank from its&#160;Webmaster Tools, saying&#58;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Reference">&quot;We've been telling people for a long time that they shouldn't focus on PageRank so much. Many site owners seem to think it's the most important&#160;metric&#160;for them to track, which is simply not true.&quot;</p><p>Another fact confirming this is that&#160;PageRank indicator was never available in Google's own&#160;Chrome&#160;browser -&#160;launched in 2008.</p><p>The visible page rank is now&#160;updated very infrequently. The last known update was in November 2013. In October 2014, <a href="https&#58;//www.mattcutts.com/blog/" target="_blank">Matt Cutts  </a> announced that another visible PageRank update would not be coming. <br></p>

<p>​<strong>Note&#58;</strong>&#160;Even though &quot;Toolbar&quot; PageRank is less important for&#160;SEO&#160;purposes, the existence of back-links from more popular websites continues to push a web page&#160;higher up in search rankings.​<br></p>
