<div>Some people like popup forms. Some do not.</div>
<div>Popup modal forms are no good:</div>
<ul><li>as you can't read or edit something else in a window behind</li>
<li>as they take a lot of time to load in a browser (ask any CRM 4 user)</li></ul>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
â€‹<div>Popup forms are good:</div>
<ul><li>as it is obvious you have an action step to perform before continuing</li>
<li>as they simplify a form that has lots of fields </li>
<li>if they can't get lost behind another window</li>
<li>if you make them clear by dimming the background (see below)</li></ul>

<dd>Figure: Bad example - if this was a popup form it would be easier to focus on where to look (as a minimum you would be looking at half the screen)</dd></dl>
<dl class="goodImage"><dt><img alt="Adobe Illustrator" src="../../assets/Popup02.jpg" /></dt>
<dd>Figure: Good example - the popup with the dimmed background is much more intuitive</dd></dl>
<div>For example, adding a webpart in SharePoint 2010 should use a popup form. <a href="http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/sharepoint.aspx#PopupForm">See our suggestion to Microsoft</a>.</div>
