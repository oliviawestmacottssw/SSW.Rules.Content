<p>Websites that use frames often don't get crawled by search engine spiders. The web was designed in such a way that every URL is supposed to correspond to a web page, and with framed websites, this is not the case. We recommend that you avoid frames altogether.<br></p>

<p>â€‹<span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">Here is what Google says on&#160;<a href="https&#58;//support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34445?hl=en">Frames</a>&#58; </span> </p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Reference">&quot;Google supports frames and iframes to the extent that it can. Frames can cause problems for search engines because they don't correspond to the conceptual model of the web. In this model, one page displays only one URL. Pages that use frames or iframes display several URLs (one for each frame) within a single page. Google tries to associate framed content with the page containing the frames, but we don't guarantee that we will.&quot;<br></p>
