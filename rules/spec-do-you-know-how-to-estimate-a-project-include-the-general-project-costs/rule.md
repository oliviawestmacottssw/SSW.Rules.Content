  <p>Estimates&#160;contain two main classes of work&#58; Work&#160;relating to the particular product (e.g. Create Customers.aspx) and work relating to the project as a whole&#160;(e.g. management, administration, testing, software audit etc.). <br></p>
<p>PBIs may&#160;only make up about&#160;60% of the total project time. Project Managers and developers should not think that the only work being charged on a project are coding tasks.<br></p>

    <strong>General Project Costs <br>
</strong>Management costs can change depending on how much management the client requires. SSW will recommend a suitable level of management. 'Management', or to put it another way&#58; 'accountability and transparency' has a cost. </p>
<p>At SSW we add general project costs as a % of the work items generally in line with the following&#58;<br></p><ul>
    <li>Testing&#58; 10-20% </li>
    <li>Fixes from testing&#58; 10-20% </li>
    <li>Software Audit&#58; 4 hours per Release - usually conducted by two experienced Architects </li>
    <li>Fixes from the Software Audit&#58; 5% </li>
    <li>Project Administration&#58; 5% - this includes items like stand up meetings, timesheets, standard updates </li>
    <li>Project Management&#58; at least 1 day per week per resource on the project (e.g. two developers full time requires a PM two days per week) UNLESS the client provides a full time Project Manager and takes full responsibility for all resources </li>
    <li>Unknowns&#58; 10%. While this is arbitrary it raises awareness for everybody ​that 'there are things we still don't know!' </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Specific Costs </strong></p>
<p>At SSW, estimates for a project will be done by a developer, checked by another developer, and finally triple checked by a project manager. While every project is different in some way, there are common elements. SSW has built an estimates calculator to assist in creating estimates. </p>
<p>See the <a href="/Pages/ReleaseEstimationProcess.aspx">SSW Menu Estimates Calculator </a>(NOTE&#58; this is an Excel template file.&#160;&#160;Save the File (&quot;Save as&quot; don't &quot;Open&quot; it) and then open the file in Windows Explorer!) </p>
<p>If the client requires a fixed price quotation a 20% premium is added to the estimates for the sprints&#160;specified in the Specification Release only (i.e. a fixed price is not given on the entire project). Requests for variations to a fixed price contract must wait until the contract is completed. If development is based on a fixed price contract, work is completed offsite only to facilitate project management and prevent unauthorized scope development.​ </p>
<p>Note&#58; It would be great if TFS&#160;had functionality “Add <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/TeamFoundationServer.aspx#StandardItems">Standard Items </a>to a Iteration (aka Sprint, Release etc.)” </p>
