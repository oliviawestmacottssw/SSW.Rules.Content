            <li>User definable workflow </li>
            <li>User definable dashboards that can show all a user's tasks etc. or all tasks related to a particular project&#160; </li>
            <li>User definable links between issues&#160; </li>
            <li>User definable fields, screens, notifications (emails), statusus, resolutions, priorities, issue types, permissions, security, filters, displays and reports </li>
            <li>Versions whereby tasks can be assigned to versions which then form an SSW release plan </li>
            <li>Full visibility of everyone's work to everyone else </li>

<p><strong><em>Of all the features above the Dashboard is the one with greatest value.&#160; We are able to configure dashbaords for individuals to know exactly what work they should be doing by when.&#160; We can configure dashboards to summarise a projects status.&#160; Consequently, non-power users of Jira can quicklty see what is going providing the visibility that we all need.</em></strong><br>
<br>
Clearly other products (like TFS) have similar features and we will be using TFS for other projects</p>
