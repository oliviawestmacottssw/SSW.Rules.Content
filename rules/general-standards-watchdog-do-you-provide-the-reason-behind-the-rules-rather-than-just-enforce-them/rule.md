                    A long time ago BF Skinner, a psychologist, proved through experiments that an animal
                    rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns
                    far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior (<em>Fundamental Techniques
                        in Handling People, Brian Elfstrom</em>).

<p>If you criticize your staff&#58;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You don't make lasting changes </li>
                    <li>They will resent you, resulting in lower productivity and employee morale</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    An example&#58; If one of your responsibilities is to make sure all your developers
                    have signed released plans you can run around with a lot of authority telling them
                    they'd better comply, but at soon as you're not around, they will resent you and
                    not bother about it.
                </p>
                A better approach is, when you see developers not using signed release plans&#58;<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask, &quot;Is there anything I can do to make it easier for you to complete the release
                        plan or make it simpler to produce?&quot; </li>
                    <li>Explain that release plans are there to make sure we are working on authorized work
                    </li>
                    <li>Explain that release plans make sure we get paid for our work - without them it
                        is hard to track work done on a project </li>
                </ul>
