​<div>However, a user thinks that either:</div>
<ol><li>They have done something wrong (i.e. they are incompetent) OR</li>
<li>The software is broken (i.e. your application is incompetent)</li></ol>
<div>Forcing the user into this opinion is a good way to make them avoid using your software in the future.</div>
<div>Instead, use the term "Information" when validation is required.</div>
