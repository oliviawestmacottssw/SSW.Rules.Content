<p>​We know that the way your inbound links are worded does make a difference, they play an important factor when Google searches are made by search engine users. Google uses the words between your &lt;a href&gt; tags to decide which websites are the most relevant to the search terms. 
   <br></p><p><strong>Having these relevant words on links also gives&#160;a&#160;more friendly experience to the users.&#160;</strong><br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
For example, if SSW had a million inbound links that described the site like this... 
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-CodeArea">&lt;a href=&quot;http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au&quot;&gt;Movies for Free&lt;/a&gt;</p>...when someone searches for &quot;free movies&quot; on Google, it would point to us. 
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">
   <br>So what does this mean? All those that are pointing to pages on your website that are displayed as 'More', 'Link', 'This' or 'Click&#160;Here'&#160;aren't&#160;doing you any favors when it comes to increasing your Google rankings.</p><div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;For tips and tricks to increase your Google Ranking
