<p>The corner stone of good user interface design is that if your users need instructions, you haven't done a good job. Of course with particularly complex applications there will be exceptions to this rule, but all developers should aim to make your interface as self evident as possible.</p>

<dd>Figure&#58; A good interface does not need instructions!</dd></dl>
<div>A good UI is&#58;</div>
<ul><li>Intuitive</li>
<li>Feels fast - eg. no white screen, threading code</li>
<li>Consistent</li>
<li>Minimal popups</li>
<li>No clutter - not busy </li>
<li>Good error handling</li>
<li>Easy to customize + apps (aka a platform)</li>
<li>Gamification eg. badges</li></ul>

<dd>Good example&#58; Teamviewer's interface requires very little explanation</dd></dl>

<dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - See the fly? (an example of excellent usability) Dutch manufacturers realized that a fly painted on the urinal became a &quot;target&quot; for men using the facility. And the fly is positioned in precisely the right place for minimal spillage or splash back. Clever people those Dutch!</dd></dl>
