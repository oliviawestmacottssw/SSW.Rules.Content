When you seek advice or help from another, firstly, you need to establish with them: 
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ul><li>Your understanding and, </li>
<li>Methods you have previously attempted in order to resolve the problem </li></ul>
<p>Tip: Be aware that you don't want themÂ to reply with <a href="http://www.lmgtfy.com">http://www.lmgtfy.com</a> </p>
<p>or the bing version <a href="http://letmebingthatforyou.com/">http://letmebingthatforyou.com</a> :-)</p>
<img alt="IM Icon" align="right" src="../../assets/ImIcon.jpg" /> <dl class="bad"><dt>How do you xxxx? </dt>
<dd>Figure: Bad Example - By not stating what you have previously attempted to resolve the problem, the person you are seeking advice from may be wasting time if they suggest methods you have already done.</dd></dl>
<dl class="good"><dt>I have searched Google but no luck... How do you xxxx? </dt>
<dd>Figure: Good Example - The person you are seeking advice from will not suggest for you to do the same methods again and will look for other ways to resolve the issue.</dd></dl>
