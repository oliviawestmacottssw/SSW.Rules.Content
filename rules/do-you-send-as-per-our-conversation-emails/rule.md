<ul><li>To make sure that you did not get the message wrong </li><li>To keep an audit trail of agreed decisions </li><li>To keep people, who were not a party to the conversation,&#160;informed about the progress </li></ul><p>Use this approach internally and with clients. As a result, expect to see &quot;as per our conversation&quot; emails that&#58;</p><ul><li>
      <strong>Require a task to be completed </strong></li><li>Explain&#160;the logic of the decision </li><li>Include URLs that&#160;were referred to</li><li>Can be referred back to in the future </li></ul><div class="greyBox"><p>
      <strong>Note&#58;</strong> This is most likely to happen after a conversation started
