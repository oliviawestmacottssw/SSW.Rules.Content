​​A String object is immutable - this means if you append two Strings together, the result is an entirely new String, rather than the original String being modified in place.&#160; This is inefficient because creating new objects is slower than altering existing objects.&#160; Using StringBuilder to append Strings modifies the underlying Char array rather than creating a new String.&#160; Therefore, whenever you are performing multiple String appends or similar functions, you should always use a StringBuilder to improve performance.<br>
