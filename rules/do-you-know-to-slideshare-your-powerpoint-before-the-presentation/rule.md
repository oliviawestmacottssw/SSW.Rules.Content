  <p>Make sure you follow these steps when preparing your presentation to ensure your work is of the highest quality... and don't forget to archive your presentation on Slideshare! </p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <ul>
    <li>Prepare your PowerPoint as normally. </li>
    <li>Remember to store all versions of your PowerPoint in SharePoint so that a record of your work may be kept. </li>
    <li>Get your work checked by a Tester for content and a designer for visual appearances. </li>
    <li>Add a slide that contain information on where to find the slides on Slideshare – incase your audience wishes to access your PowerPoint later. </li>
    <li>Once your presentation has been finalized, add a version number on the first slide before uploading the document to Slideshare (this will help you know later what version is on Slideshare and if it needs to be updated) </li>
    <li>Before you are ready to present, add a text file in SharePoint that links to the Slideshare url (at SSW we use the naming format “_OnSlideshare.txt”) </li>
    <li>Present! And have fun. </li>
</ul>
