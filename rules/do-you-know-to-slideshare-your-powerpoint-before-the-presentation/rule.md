  <p>What is Shareshare? <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> is an online archive of presentations and other documents. It is the best way to store your training material for search engines and is easily accessible. Follow these steps to ensure you get as much coverage possible before and after your presentation.<p>
</p></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Prepare your PowerPoint as normal. Refer to <a shape="rect" href="/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/Pages/default.aspx">SSW Rules to Better Presentations.</a> </li>
    <li>Work on your presentation from SharePoint to maintain a version on the document. </li>
    <li>Get your content checked by a tester and a designer (See our Rule&#58; <a shape="rect" href="/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/Pages/DoyougetsomeonetodoaTestPlease.aspx">Do you get someone to do a 'Test Please'?</a>) </li>
    <li>Before you upload to Slideshare, add two slides&#58;
    <ol>
        <li>Add a generic Slideshare link on the last slide; this could be something as simple as <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//www.slideshare.net/YourAccount">http&#58;//www.slideshare.net/YourAccount</a> - at SSW we use <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//www.slideshare.net/SSWConsulting/">http&#58;//www.Slideshare.net/SSWConsulting/</a> </li>
        <li>One at the start of the presentation that contains the version of the document. This is so that you can compare easily what version is on SharePoint and what is one Slideshare </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Rename your PowerPoint to include the version number. For example, if the file in SharePoint is called “SharePoint-Jonah-Lomu-of-CMS.pptx” it will be renamed to “SharePoint-Jonah-Lomu-of-CMS-ver1-9.pptx” </li>
    <li>Upload to Slideshare </li>
    <li>Don’t forget to add a “_OnSlideshare.txt” in SharePoint that contains the url </li>
    <li>Now you can present! </li>
</ol>
