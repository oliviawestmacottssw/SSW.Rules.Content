<p>
                    In some cases you may need to display text content on your page with a specific
                    font. Unfortunately web browsers don't provide an easy way to deliver rich typography
                    without sacrificing some functionality. Common approaches include&#58;</p><ol><li style="text-decoration&#58;line-through;">Display the text as an image</li><li style="text-decoration&#58;line-through;">sIFR</li><li>Font stacking​</li><li>Google Fonts​​​</li><li>Self-hosting​</li><li>Webfont services</li></ol>

<p>​​Each method mentioned above has their disadvantages. We discourage #1 and #2 - Images are bad for Google juice and cannot be selected;​&#160;sFIR uses old technology based on nearly dead&#160;Flash.</p><p>For more information on the other methods&#160;read&#58;&#160;<span style="line-height&#58;20px;"><a href="http&#58;//www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/03/the-best-way-to-serve-fonts-to-your-website/%E2%80%8B" target="_blank">The best way to serve fonts to your website</a>.</span></p><br>
