<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​You should always try and reply to emails within a timely period, but&#160;this is not always possible.​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Sometimes people see an email 6 months old and just delete it because it's &quot;too old&quot; or&#160;refuse to reply because &quot;the customer will think we're a joke taking this long to do something!&quot; This is a great way to lose business, no matter how long it takes to do some tasks, it's always better to get it done.&#160;Of course, there are tasks that appear to be irrelevant with the passage of time, so reply and state that you don’t believe it is needed now.<br></p><p>Example&#58;&#160;A product suggestion might take 12 months to get around to, but when it's done&#160;the customer should be informed and get a link to the new version - it's possible that their need still exists, and they'll know that their ideas and suggestions are not ignored. </p><dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/delete-outlook-message-button.png" alt="delete-outlook-message-button.png" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - Hitting the “Delete” button without replying</dd></dl><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">Hi Bob,<br>This is an old one.

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Reply to emails&#160;regardless of how long it takes to respond. It shows you value the sender's&#160;feedback.​​​<br></p>
