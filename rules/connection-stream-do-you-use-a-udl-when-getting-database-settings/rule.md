<p>Why do people always invent ways of getting the same old server name and a database name? Look at this image from <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/SQLservertools.aspx#SpeedFerret">Speed Ferret</a> - one of my favorite SQL Server utilities.</p>

<div>While a nice form, it would have taken quite some developer time to get it right. Not only that, it is a little bit different than what a user has seen before. Now look at this UDL from one of our utilities <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/SQLAuditor">SSW SQL Auditor</a>&#58;</div>

<div>Every developer has seen this before - so use it. Better still, it is only a few lines of code&#58; <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/Codebase/05VB-Net/B-Open%20UDL%20Dialog-DH.txt">B-Open UDL Dialog-DH.txt</a> </div>

<dd>Figure&#58; Coming in Visual Studio .NET 2005 Microsoft are yet to release an API to do this</dd></dl>

<h4>Exception</h4>
<div>The above cannot be used when you want the user to create a new database. Microsoft does not supply an out of the box UI and there is no third party solution. Only in this case you have to create your own form.</div>
