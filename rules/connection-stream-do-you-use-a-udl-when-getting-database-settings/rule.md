<p>Why do people always invent ways of getting the same old server name and a database name? Look at this image from <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/SQLservertools.aspx#SpeedFerret">Speed Ferret</a> - one of my favorite SQL Server utilities.</p>

Not only that, it is a little bit different than what a user has seen before.

Microsoft does not supply an out of the box UI and there is no third party solution. Only in this case you have to create your own form.</div><dl class="image"><dt> <img alt="SQL Deploy uses its own custom form " src="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/SQLDeploy.jpg" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; SQL Deploy uses its own custom form for &quot;selecting&quot; a database name</dd></dl>
