The best way to show the features of a product is creating a video. The information you are able to communicate in seconds of a video would take hundreds of words of text to explain.

Videos are also important for services, but for products, it should be **on the homepage** .

<dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="dropbox-homepage.jpg" alt="Dropbox homepage"></dt><dd><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Good Example - Dropbox homepage</a> has no text but a video that shows nicely how it works<br></dd></dl>
### Videos are also good for SEO

By embedding videos onto your website it will help get the videos more views, which is a determinant for Google nowadays.
