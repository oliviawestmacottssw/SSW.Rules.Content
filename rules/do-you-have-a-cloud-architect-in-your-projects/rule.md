<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​The goal of a modern complex software project is to build software with the best software architecture and great cloud architecture. Software developers should be focusing on good code and good software architecture. Azure and AWS are big beasts and it should be a specialist responsibility.<br></p>

This runs the risk of choosing the wrong services and baking in bad architecture. The associated code is hard and expensive to change, and also the monthly bill can be higher than needed.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">The focus must be to build solid foundations and a rock-solid API. The reality is even 1 day of a Cloud Architect at the beginning of a project, can save $100K later on.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">

The Cloud Architect should review and sign off that the project is good to go. They mostly check the 3 horsemen (load, security, and cost).<br>
