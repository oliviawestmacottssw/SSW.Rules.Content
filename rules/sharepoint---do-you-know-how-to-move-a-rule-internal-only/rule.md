Moving a rule page from a folder to another is not needed anymore. All rule pages are staying in the same library (folder called "Pages") since we moved the rule pages from 100+ subwebs into the root one.

If you want a rule page to be shown on a different rule summary page, simply change the "Rule Category" field value to the relevant one (see step #7 on [Do you know how to create a rule?](/Pages/how-to-create-a-rule.aspx))

Sometimes you might need to move a rule from a category to another. You can do this by following these steps:

(Steps 1 and 2 can be skipped by clicking on [this link](/_layouts/15/sitemanager.aspx?Source=%7bWebUrl%7d_layouts/15/settings.aspx) )

2. Under "Site Administration", click on "Content and structure": <br>      <dl class="image" style="text-decoration:line-through;">&lt;dt&gt;

         &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Find the rule to be moved and click on the small arrow beside it, then click on "Move..."</dd></dl>
4. Select the new location where the rule should be: <br>      <dl class="image" style="text-decoration:line-through;">&lt;dt&gt;
            <img src="select-new-place.png" alt="select-new-place.png" style="width:459px;">
         &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Navigate through categories and click on the place the rule should be moved to and click "OK"</dd></dl>
