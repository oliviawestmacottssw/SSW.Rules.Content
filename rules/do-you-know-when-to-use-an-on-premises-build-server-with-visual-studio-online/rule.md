If you are using <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Online</a>, there's an awesome <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2012/03/27/build-on-the-team-foundation-service.aspx">Hosted Build Server</a> option you can use to perform your builds with little to no setup. But if you're working on a project that has continuous integration and a long build time, it's not long before those build minutes start to add up.
