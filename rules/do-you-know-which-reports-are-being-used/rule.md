SSRS keeps track of each report that gets executed and records useful information like&#58;<br><div><ul><li><span style="line-height&#58;19.5px;">How long did the report take to generate<br></span></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;19.5px;">Who requested the report</span></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;19.5px;">When was the report generated</span></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;19.5px;">Report Parameters used</span></li></ul><div>So it's quite simply a matter of querying the ReportServer database for information in the ExecutionLog table.&#160;<br></div></div>
