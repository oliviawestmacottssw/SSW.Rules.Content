In the course of business I often provide some services or products to selected customers free of charge or at a discount rate. Often because you're waiving one rule (the &quot;please pay me&quot; one!) you waive all your normal rules of service. This is a very bad habit for two reasons&#58; 
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ol><li><strong>Freebies/discounts need just as strict controls as regular projects</strong>
<p>When you are giving something away at a discount or for free you are expecting a loss compared with a regular client. If you fail to follow regular processes not only will you incur an even greater loss you provide a lesser standard of service and put greater risk on the success of the project. </p>
<p>A discount or freebie should follow all the standard processes such as&#58; </p>

<li><a href="/Management/RulesToHappyClients/Pages/DoYouKnowWhatTasksAreInAReleasePlanInAdditionToDevelopmentWorkItems.aspx">triaging additional items</a> </li>
<li><a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/ReleaseDebrief.aspx">release debriefs</a> </li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Feedback on service</strong> 
<p>Often the people you choose to provide a freebie are the best people to provide feedback on your product or services. When you waive all your standard processes, they have no opportunity to review how you conduct your business. So if I'm offering a freebie (or any discount), I ensure every normal standard of business is followed (including sending $0 invoices!) and I ensure I get valuable feedback to help me run SSW better.</p>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> When entering timesheets for free work, set your rate to $0</p></li></ol>
