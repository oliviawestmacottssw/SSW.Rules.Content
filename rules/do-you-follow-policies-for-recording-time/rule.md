      <dl class="goodImage">
         <dt>
            <img src="/PublishingImages/timesheet-accuracy.jpg" alt="" />
         </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example - Inform accurately how much time you spent for​&#160;each client</dd></dl></li><li>Follow 
      <a href="/Pages/how-to-describe-the-work.aspx">Do you know how to describe the work you have done?​</a> </li><li>Record all the work you do for a client, even if it is to be written off</li><li>If you are working with another employee, ensure your times are consistent, in both time and category</li><li>If you are providing telephone support, count your time in 15 minute blocks</li><li>If you work for a client 4 times in a day for 15 minutes each, feel free to enter one timesheet for 1 hour, listing the 4 things you did.
