  <p>Some email threads go on forever... sometimes the topic subtly changes... so when should you change the subject?<br>
The answer is &quot;cautiously&quot;.<br>
The reason is email threading.</p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>So when do you change it?</p>
<ul>
    <li>When the original email theme has been superceded by new content, you should change the email subject to a more relevant description of the content of the thread.<br>
    E.g. from<strong> &quot;Field of Study&quot;</strong><br>
    to <strong>&quot;Next Years Conference WAS&#58; Field of Study&quot;</strong></li>
    <li>Also if the original subject was generic e.g. &quot;Reminder&quot; or &quot;Invoice&quot; (especially when automatically generated) then upon reply change the subject by adding the client or project name to the email subject.<br>
    E.g. from <strong>&quot;Invoice&quot;</strong><br>
    to <strong>&quot;IBM WAS&#58; Invoice&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
