This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
For each story The Team self-organises to decide HOW to implement it.&#160; They create tasks, with sub-tasks whre necessary, for everything that needs to be done to implement the story.&#160; Every task and sub-task&#160;should be given an estimate&#160;in hours and the same value placed in the Remaining field.<br>
<br>
No actual work on the Sprint should start until this planning is complete.&#160; It is these Remaining hours that determine the first&#160; value in the burndown chart which sets the Sprint on its way to ceompletion.&#160; There must be no omissions or The Team will start without an accurate burndown and we all know that &quot;The Team is nothing without a burndown&quot;.<br>
<br>
The Team should also ensure that the burndown chart is working and will be automatically sent to all members of The Scrum Team&#160;overnight.&#160; <br>
<br>
The meeting concludes when The Team reports to the ScrumMaster that their planning is complete and they are able to display the burndown chart.<br>
<br>
Ideally this meeting is timeboxed to as may hours as there will be weeks in the Sprint.&#160; However, this planning is so essentail that it must continue to completion outside the meeeting if necessary. <br>
<br>
It is not essentail for the Product Owner or the Scrum Master to be present for the whole meeting but they must be available for consultation.&#160; The ScrumMastershould fromally close the meeting.
