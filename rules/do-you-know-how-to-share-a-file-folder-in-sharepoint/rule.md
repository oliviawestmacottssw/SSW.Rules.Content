You often need to share&#160;links&#160;to a file or folder in SharePoint. â€‹<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>You can select the folder (or file) and click on &quot;Copy link&quot; at the top bar to get the link&#58;<br></p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/sharepoint-cloud-copy-folder.jpg" alt="sharepoint-cloud-copy-folder.jpg" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Getting URL&#160;from SharePoint top bar <br></dd></dl><p><b>Note&#58;</b> You can also right-click the folder/file to copy the link.<br></p><p>On previous versions, you can open the menu on ellipsis link and get it from there&#58;</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/sharepoint-link.jpg" alt="sharepoint-link.jpg" style="width&#58;800px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Getting URL&#160;from SharePoint ellipsis menu</dd></dl><p>Now, if you want a link to a file (won't work well for folders)&#160;you can always right click and copy it from the browser prompt&#58;</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/browser-link.jpg" alt="browser-link.jpg" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Getting a file&#160;URL from right click. The&#160;disadvantages&#160;are that it doesn't work fine for a folder and&#160;that you can't see the link before the paste </dd></dl>
