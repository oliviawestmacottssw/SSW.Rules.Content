<!--endintro-->

A message box automatically provides this functionality so there is no need to manually put a beep right before a message box pops up.
<dl class="badCode">&lt;dt&gt;<pre>        Dim Message As String = "You did not enter a server name. Cancel this operation?"
        Dim Caption As String = "No Server Name Specified"
        Dim Buttons As Integer = MessageBoxButtons.YesNo
        Beep()
        result = MessageBox.Show( Me, Message, Caption, Buttons)
                    </pre>&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: Bad example - The sound on the button is hardcoded in this code snippet</dd></dl><dl class="goodCode">&lt;dt&gt;<pre>        Dim Message As String = "You did not enter a server name. Cancel this operation?"
        Dim Caption As String = "No Server Name Specified"
        Dim Buttons As Integer = MessageBoxButtons.YesNo
        result = MessageBox.Show( Me, Message, Caption, Buttons)
                    </pre>&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: The code is not present in this example as it is automatically done</dd></dl>
