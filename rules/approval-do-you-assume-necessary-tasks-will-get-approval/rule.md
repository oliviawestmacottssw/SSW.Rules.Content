When you are working on a project, you need to follow the <a href="/Management/RulesToHappyClients/Pages/DoYouGetWorkApprovedBeforeYouDoIt.aspx" shape="rect">get work approved before you do it</a> rule. However, you should assume some tasks will be approved by a client and do them anyway. This of course depends on the size of the task (e.g.&#160;half hour&#160;or less) and the obviousness of the task.
