You can do this by adding the room name to&#160;the Location field. If it is the SSW Chapel, it will then appear in the Chapel Bookings calendar and alert all necessary parties that you will be using the space.<br></p><p>It's important to always add the address information in appointments when a third party is included. i.e.&#58;<br></p>
<ul>
<li>A client meeting at your location</li>
<li>A meeting at the client location<br></li>
</ul>
<p>The exception is for internal meeting appointments&#58;</p>

<p>I would invite Zune to work Saturday @ SSW (but not include the address)
