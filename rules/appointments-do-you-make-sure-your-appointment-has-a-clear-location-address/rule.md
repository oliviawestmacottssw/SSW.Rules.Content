You can do this by adding the room name to the Location field. If it is the SSW Chapel, it will then appear in the Chapel Bookings calendar and alert all necessary parties that you will be using the space. <br>If you do this, you should still also add the street address so external people know where to go.​<br></p><div><p>It's important to always add the address information in appointments when a third party is included. i.e.:<br></p><ul><li>A client meeting at your location<br></li><li>A meeting at the client location<br></li></ul><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">The exception is for internal meeting appointments:​<br></p><div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">You should invite a coworker to work with you in the boardroom (but not include the address) <br></p></div></div>
