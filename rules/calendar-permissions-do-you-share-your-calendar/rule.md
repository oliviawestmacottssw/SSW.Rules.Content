<p>​​​Within a company,&#160;there are occasions that ​you are not able to access your computer to send sick emails, or you get a call from your client on the way to the office that you have to drive to a&#160;​client site straight away; when such things happen, you need someone else to update your calendar when you call in, so others are aware of your availabilities. <br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>So always make sure the admin people are able to access your calendar with full permission in order to add/edit/delete appointments for you. ​</p><dl class="image"><dt>
