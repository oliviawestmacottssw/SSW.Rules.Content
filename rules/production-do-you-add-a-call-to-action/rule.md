Without a call to action prompting viewers to do something at the end of a video, the purpose of the video is lost. As such, make sure you include the call to action at the end.
 Common objectives are to: 
* Get them to the company's Facebook page
* Obtain the viewer's email address
* Get the viewer to provide info and request a service from the company


<!--endintro-->

A good 'call to action' should:

1. Be short (around 30 seconds).
2. Not have too many options. A visitor is much more likely to do a task if he's not confused by being given 24 social media options.
3. (Optionally) Tell them they get value eg. if they comment they will make a difference.
4. If you have a paid subscription offering or a free one like YouTube) give incentives to subscribe now, along with the benefits subscribed users get.
5. Remember that people have different preferences for social media. You pretty much need to cover your bases. Have a Twitter page, Facebook page, Linked-in account, YouTube channel etc. Of course don't have all these in the 'call to action', but make sure that those options are easily accessible.
6. If you are using YouTube or another service that provides the option to have annotations, use annotations that prompt the viewer to comment or subscribe. A 'subscribe' link in the annotation gets more subscribers

Figure: Bad example - too many options breeds choice paralysis














Figure: Fairly Good example (skip to the end) – a simple task to email hamids@axosoft.com, plus links to social media are present, however there is too much on screen and he has used a graphic instead of live action.

 **Figure: Good Example – very clear call to action that asks for an email address. Only asks for one thing at a time and uses zooming effects. In addition, gives a twitter option to engage and uses live action.**
