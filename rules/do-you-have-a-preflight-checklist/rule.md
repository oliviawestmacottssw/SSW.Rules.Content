Before starting any work, you should ensure developers take a look at your Application Insights data to make sure everything is performing correctly. 
<!--endintro-->



Most developers check only this first item before starting their work:

1. Check Unit Tests are Green


![Tests are green. I'm ready to start work... or am I?](unittests.png)



More advanced teams check their application insights data as well. This includes:

2. Look for any new Unhandled Exceptions


> See [Do you know the daily process to improve the health of your web application?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=87dd82da-1716-4112-97f9-9161398eee1c)

3. Look for any obvious performance issues (Server then client).
