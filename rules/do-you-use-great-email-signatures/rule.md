Email signatures are a great way of adding some advertising and branding. You should always use a nice email signature for  **external emails** .
Internally, you shouldn't use any or just use a short one (just your name or initials).




Full email signatures are great when they have:

* A little  **branding** and advertising (can be a tagline or company news), so people know instantly who it is from
* Your  **phone number** (in international format - it's important to add the country code so people from all around the world can easily add you to their contacts - as per [Do you know the right format to show phone numbers?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=19e719e8-a1ff-47c4-a642-5c7e3189f25e))
* Your company  **website link** (e.g. www.ssw.com.au/)
* Your work-related  **social media** and  **blog** link
* Your **position**
* Your  **location** (city/country) where you are based


Mobile signature are not easily customized so they can be simpler.

### PC Long Signature

**Use the complete "long signature" when sending a new email or appointment to a client.**

This is created in HTML and goes well on emails with Word used as the email editor. Include some product advertising, like what's new on your monthly newsletter. It should have the company colors.

### PC Short Signature




Use a really short signature (your first name or initials) or no signature at all in internal emails  as people already know who you are.

**Note #1:** You can see Ulysses using this rule in practice, along with other best practices, on this short [demonstration video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAqRokqq4jI)
