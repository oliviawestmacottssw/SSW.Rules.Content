<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">At the end of the day, when all the people on your prospect list have been called and you're just about ready to throw in the towel, there's still one more task to complete. You need to remember that an outbound campaign is just like any other business campaign - it needs to show an ROI (Return on Investment). Management needs to be made aware of its success or its failures.​​<br></p>
