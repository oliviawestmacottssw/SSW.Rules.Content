<p>
          Directly querying the table bypasses the security and filtering of MSCRM as well
          as not being supported by Microsoft. Thisâ€‹ is not the correct method for reports
          to be written.
          <br>
          The correct filtered views can be found under the Views section of the CRM database
          and these are the Views that should always be used to design SQL Reporting Services
          reports.
