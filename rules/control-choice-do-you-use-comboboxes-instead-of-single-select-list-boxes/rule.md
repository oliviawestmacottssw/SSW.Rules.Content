<div>ComboBoxes are better than List Boxes <strong>for data entry</strong> because:</div>
<ul><li>They occupy less screen space</li>
<li>They are less trouble to scroll through, owing to the fact that you can afford to have more room for the list (as it's collapsed most of the time)</li>
<li>As you can see in the figures below, using a combo also makes the required field indicator (<span style="color:red;">*</span>) easier to see.</li></ul>

<div><strong>Note: When are single-select list boxes OK?</strong></div>
<div>As mentioned before, there are exceptions to this rule. It would be hard to imagine the Include/Exclude boxes in the SQL Server Enterprise Manager's Server Registration Wizard being handled with ComboBoxes, for example.</div>
