ComboBoxes are better than List Boxes  **for data entry** because:

* They occupy less screen space
* They are less trouble to scroll through, owing to the fact that you can afford to have more room for the list (as it's collapsed most of the time)
* As you can see in the figures below, using a combo also makes the required field indicator (\*) easier to see.

 **Note: When are single-select list boxes OK?** 

As mentioned before, there are exceptions to this rule. It would be hard to imagine the Include/Exclude boxes in the SQL Server Enterprise Manager's Server Registration Wizard being handled with ComboBoxes, for example.
