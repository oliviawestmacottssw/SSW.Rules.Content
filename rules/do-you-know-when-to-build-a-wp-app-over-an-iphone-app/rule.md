                    <s>If your app is built on Silverlight today.</s> Stop building things on Silverlight today.
                </li><li>
                    Reasons are&#58;<br>
                <ul><li>Time to market</li><li>Lower cost</li><li>Reuse MVVM</li><li>Reuse Silverlight controls</li><li>Reuse the Business and Data layer</li></ul></li><li>
                    The Biggest thing going for windows phone is&#58;<br>
                <ul><li>.NET dev shops</li><li>Environment more productive than xcode</li></ul><p>
                    Note&#58; WP7 is built on Silverlight 3 (not Silverlight 4)</p><p>
                    Note&#58; WP7 was built by a 'web team' not &quot;Rich client app team', so some issues exist&#58;</p><ul><li>Bing map control relies on host page (authentication)</li><li>Avoid using System.Windows.Browser.dll in your Silverlight App (as it works only
                        OOB on desktop) and you will have to use a different control on Windows Phone 7</li></ul></li><li>
                    Others reasons are&#58;
                    <ul><li>You can deploy your app without going through the appstore/market place. E.g. my
