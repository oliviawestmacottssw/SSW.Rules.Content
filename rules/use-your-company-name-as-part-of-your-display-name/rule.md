<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Be aware that while you can change your display name, Skype doesn't allow you to rename the account... So use your full name. If you just use "Peter", then people​ can't distinguish you from the 3 other Peters they have.</p><p><b>Tip: </b>If you travel around people often will ask you<b></b> "Where are you?"<br>You can avoid this by putting the square brackets where you currently are. E.g. [SSW Brisbane] or [Cisco Melbourne]<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Related rule​​<br></h3><p><a href=/use-your-personal-message-to-share-good-news-with-your-contacts>Do you use your personal message to share good news with your contacts?</a><br></p>
