<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​A person's signature is extremely valuable. Getting a signature is hard work. Salespeople use all sorts of euphemisms to avoid that confronting request&#58; &quot;if you could just sign here...&quot; ​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>However, requesting a <b>signature</b> (or just an initial) on non-contractual type documents (especially screenshots, mockups,&#160;or data-schemas)&#160;is very beneficial.&#160;</p><p>When you ask a client to 'review this screen mock-up' they will generally take a cursory glance, perhaps make a comment or two and then move on to something else. Asking them to initial/sign the document always makes them take a second or third look,&#160;ask someone else, or at least spend a few more minutes working out whether it's correct or not.</p><p>Training clients to&#160;review the&#160;work carefully leads to better quality projects.&#160;<br></p><dl class="image"><dt>
