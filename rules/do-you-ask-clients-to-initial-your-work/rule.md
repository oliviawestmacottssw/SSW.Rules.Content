A person's signature is extremely valuable. Getting a signature is hard work. Salespeople use all sorts of euphemisms to avoid that confronting request&#58; &quot;if you could just sign here...&quot; <br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>However, requesting a signature (or just an initial) on non-contractual type documents, especially screen-shots or data-schemas, is very beneficial. When you ask a client to 'review this screen mock-up' they will generally take a cursory glance, perhaps make a comment or two and then move on to something else. Asking them to then initial the print-out of the screen mock-up always makes them take a second or third look, ask someone else, or at least spend a few more minutes working out whether it's correct.</p><p>Training clients to continually review work carefully leads to better quality work.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" border="0" src="/PublishingImages/SuccessfulProjects_Signature.jpg" alt="signature" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; A signature can be very valuable but sometimes hard to obtain</dd></dl><h3>Related Rule</h3><ul><li><a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=63802172-2609-4a24-816b-bbf10a190109">Do you conduct specification analysis by creating mock-ups?​​</a></li></ul>
