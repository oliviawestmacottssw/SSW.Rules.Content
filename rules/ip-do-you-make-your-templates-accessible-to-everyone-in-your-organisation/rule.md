<p>A common mistake&#160;is to use code or&#160;emails that you have previously written, and stored somewhere on your computer, and change around key bits to make it relevant for the current situation.</p>
                <p>The problem with this is that you make it impossible for anyone else in your organization to do the same task to the same quality level. </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Make sure your company has a common code base and&#160;email template store and endeavourâ€‹ to improve it regularly. This shares knowledge across your organization and makes sure everyone is working to the level that your company standards require. </p>
