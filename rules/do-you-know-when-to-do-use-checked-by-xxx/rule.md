 ​There are times you should have your email checked by someone else before sending. Examples are:

- Where you are a little unsure
- When you are new to a company and sending an email to a large distribution list
- Sending a complicated email
- Sending a sensitive email (where the content could be perceived as confrontational)
- In application development, when you need a quick '[test please](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=d66a9404-2ca9-4d19-ad6c-df1618b4fc28)', an​d the person is immediately available. This​ provides you a chance to check and collaborate on the finished change before the '[done email](/Pages/Done-GiveDetailsAndDelete.aspx)' is sent


Doing this will ensure:​

- You avoid grammatical and spelling errors
- The layout and tone of the email is professional
- You haven’t forgotten anything important
- The receiver knows who else agrees with the content
