It is extremely important to demonstrate to potential clients a high level of quality service and attention to their needs; this is why, at SSW, whenever we receive an email from a potential client in relation to possible consulting work, we make sure they receive an answer within 5 minutes of us receiving it. We do this for 2 reasons&#58;

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <ul>
    <li>To show we are keen and give an indication of the level of service they will receive </li>
    <li>To stop them &quot;shopping around&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p>They will quickly recognize that they will not receive that kind of service anywhere else!</p>
