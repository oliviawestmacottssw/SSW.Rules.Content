People are not mind-readers (unless they are telepathic!), so when you get good feedback from a client, make sure you get the recognition for it. There is nothing wrong with getting brownie points for the work you have done and making sure the boss at the client site and your manager know about it.

Assuming you are an awesome worker, there are a whole bunch of smaller ways of getting brownie points and they are all around good communication:

* Doing or sending a <br>      [Daily Scrum](/DailyStandUpScrum)
* Sending a "[To myself](/EmailToMyself)" after taking requirements from a client
* Sending a <br>      [Done](/SendDoneEmailInScrum) with a screenshot after you have completed the task
* Doing a <br>      [Done Video](/Do-you-send-done-videos)
* Preparing and doing a great <br>      [Sprint Review](/SprintReviewMeeting) and sending an <br>      [email](/Do-you-create-a-Sprint-Review-email)
* Sending an <br>      [invoice with plenty of comments](/how-to-describe-the-work)
* Sharing your knowledge at a <br>      [user group](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/) (aka Meetup) presentation
* [Recording or live-streaming your user group presentation](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Video-Production/Conference-Video-Recording.aspx) and uploading it to Youtube
