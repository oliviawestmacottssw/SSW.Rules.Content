<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​​It's been said that in order to succeed you have to show up – nowhere is that more true than the workplace.&#160;Knowing where your staff are is paramount.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​At the beginning of each day you should&#58;<br></p><ol><li>Review a staffing report – consider a report in Power BI or a similar tool that shows which of your staff are booked for what activities on any given day
   <dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/BookedInDays.jpg" alt="PowerBI Staffing Photo_1.jpg" style="width&#58;641px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Green is booked, Black is booked for internal work, and Red is leave<br></dd></dl></li><li>Make updates to staff bookings as required in the source calendars&#160;so that the booked in days report is an accurate representation of what clients staff are assigned to.&#160;Ensure that any other staffing or service calendars are also updated to accurately reflect the day's planned activities.<dl class="image"><dt><img src="/SiteAssets/know-where-your-staff-is/Service%20Calendar.jpg" alt="Service Calendar.jpg" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; See 4 blue bars. This means they are booked. Not easy eh!<br></dd></dl></li><li>Review your absence calendar.&#160;Each business should have a calendar where employees can note any upcoming absences or leave so that it's easy for other team members to know where folks are at any given time.

You can use a tool like SophieBot or other tools to find out who's physically in your office at any time
