When preparing a Boot to VHD image it is important to know the size of the partition which is setup inside the VHD file – you should make a note of this when you create the VHD image. The reason for this is because the VHD file will expand to the size of the partition <strong>INSIDE </strong>the VHD.

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>For Example&#58; </p>
<ul>
    <li>A Windows installation called <strong>WindowsInVHD </strong>inside the VHD file has a partition size of 60GB. </li>
    <li>It is copied to the D&#58;\ drive of a laptop called <strong>Frog </strong>and only takes up 10GB of space (as it is a dynamic expanding VHD). </li>
    <li>When you boot into <strong>WindowsInVHD </strong>(the VHD sitting on <strong>Frog’s </strong>D&#58;\ drive), the VHD file expands to 60GB - the partition size of <strong><strong>WindowsInVHD.</strong></strong> </li>
    <li>This means you will need at least 60GB of free space on <strong>Frog’s </strong>D&#58;\ drive free </li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have free space equal to the size of the partition inside the VHD image, you will get a blue screen telling you that you are out of hard drive space.</p>
