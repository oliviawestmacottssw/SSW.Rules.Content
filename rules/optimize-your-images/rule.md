<p>The first thing is to <a href=/do-you-know-how-to-save-your-graphics-in-the-right-format>save your graphics in the right format</a> ​and size. After that, you should run an image optimizer. <br></p><p>Some tips and techniques to keep in mind as you work on optimizing your images:<br></p><ul><li> 
      <b style="background-color:initial;">Don't be afraid to dial down the "quality" settings</b><span style="background-color:initial;"> if the results are very good and byte savings are significant</span><br></li><li>
