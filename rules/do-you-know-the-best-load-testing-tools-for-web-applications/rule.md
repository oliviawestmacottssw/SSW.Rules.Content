We recommend setting up a simply load test on the infrastructure like setting up a web server that serves 1 image and having the load tests simply fetch that image.</p><p class="p1">This simple test will highlight&#58;&#160;<br></p><ul><li>Maximum performance you can expect (are your goals realistic for the infrastructure)</li><li>Identify any network related issues</li><li>Uplink bandwidth, DDOS protection, firewall issues​​<br></li></ul>
