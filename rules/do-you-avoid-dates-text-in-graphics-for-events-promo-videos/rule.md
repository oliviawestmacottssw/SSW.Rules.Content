To maximize reusability and minimize costs, itâ€™s best to avoid including dates as text in graphics for promotional videos.

<!--endintro-->
<dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="events-dates-bad.png" alt="events-dates-bad.png" style="width:750px;"></dt><dd>Figure: Bad example - dates shown as text in graphics (creates extra work to change every time)</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="events-dates-good.png" alt="events-dates-good.png" style="width:750px;"></dt><dd>Figure: Good example - no dates shown as text in graphics (can be re-used without editing)</dd></dl>
If there is some particular value/purpose in including dates there may be exceptions to this rule.
