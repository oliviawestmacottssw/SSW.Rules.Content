<dl class="badImage"><dt>​<img src="/PublishingImages/events-dates-bad.png" alt="events-dates-bad.png" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - dates shown as text in graphics (creates extra work to change every time)</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/events-dates-good.png" alt="events-dates-good.png" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example - no dates shown as text in graphics (can be re-used without editing)</dd></dl>​
