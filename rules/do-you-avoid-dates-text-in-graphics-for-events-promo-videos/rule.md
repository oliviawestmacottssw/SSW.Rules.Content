To maximize reusability and minimize costs, it’s best to avoid including dates as text in graphics for promotional videos.​​
 ​![events-dates-bad.png](events-dates-bad.png)Figure: Bad example - dates shown as text in graphics (creates extra work to change every time)![events-dates-good.png](events-dates-good.png)Figure: Good example - no dates shown as text in graphics (can be re-used without editing)​ 
If there is some particular value/purpose in including dates there may be exceptions to this rule.
