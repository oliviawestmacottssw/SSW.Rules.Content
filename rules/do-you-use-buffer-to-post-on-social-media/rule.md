<p>​​​Buffer is a great tool for managing multiple social media accounts across a range of sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, twitter, app.net and google+. It allows you to choose which accounts to post to, can post to multiple social media accounts at once, and even lets you write and schedule your posts to be released over the course of a day or even up to a week, so you don't need to be at your computer while maintaining an online presence. It also offers URL shortening and provides analytics so you can track the success of your posts across multiple sites.</p>

<p>​You can either visit the <a href="https&#58;//bufferapp.com/app/">Buffer web app</a> in your browser, or install a tool that sits next to the address bar of your browser. ​</p><img src="/PublishingImages/buffer_tool.jpg" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /><div><strong style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Figure&#58; to use the Buffer app from your browser, simply click the symbol</strong><div><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;"><b><br></b></span><strong style="line-height&#58;1.6;"></strong><p>&#160;<img src="/PublishingImages/buffer_screenshot.jpg" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br><strong style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Figure&#58; when a URL is included in the post, Buffer prefills the text and content, and allows you to cycle through which image from the page you'd like to use (or not use one at all)</strong></p><p><strong style="line-height&#58;1.6;"><br></strong></p><p><strong>Consistency&#58;<br></strong><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">The content of your posts should be consistent across accounts. When making a post that exceeds the character limit of a site such as twitter, you should write a separate, shorter version of the post to send to that site only. </span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">​</span></p><p><strong>Hashtags&#58;<br></strong><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Hashtags are used across social sites such as twitter, Facebook and google+ to identify&#160;a&#160;keyword&#160;or&#160;topic&#160;of&#160;interest&#160;and&#160;facilitate&#160;a&#160;search&#160;for&#160;similar posts on the topic.</span></p><p>Establish a short hashtag that can be easily associated with your brand, company, or campaign and ensure this hashtag is used consistently across social networks, along with any other keywords relevant to the content of your post.</p><p>Note&#58; LinkedIn does not support hashtags. If you use them in a post, they will show up on LinkedIn pages as plain text. </p><p>For more on SSW hashtags, check out <a href="/Pages/HashTags.aspx">Do you know how to use Hashtags?</a></p><p><strong>Custom URL shortening&#58;<br></strong><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Buffer uses bit.ly to shorten URLs. You can create custom URLs at no cost by joining bit.ly and going into Settings | Advanced. This will allow even your shortened URL to carry your unique brand without the look of a long, untidy URL.</span></p><p>For more on bit.ly and URL shortening, check out <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=d3e8f047-751d-4ed3-a912-9988c20cf91a">Rules to Better bit.ly</a></p><p>&#160;</p><p><br>&#160;</p></div></div>
