<p>​​​​​​​In any job, you will most likely at some point face some criticism. Someone may be telling you that you’ve done something wrong or just expressing displeasure because you didn’t do something they wanted.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>The best way to take this is to reply to the person, and tell them the following the&#160;3 A's.<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">The three A’s&#58;&#160;​Acknowledge, Apologize, Act&#160;​​<br></h3><ol><li>The first part of a good customer service&#160;is&#160;<b>acknowledging</b>&#160;that something happened. If you don't acknowledge the other person won't know if you agree or not that&#160;something is wrong.<br></li><li><strong>Apologize </strong>if you are at fault, <strong>Accept </strong>the feedback/criticism if you are not.<br></li><li>​Lastly, explain how you will take <b>action</b>&#160;now, and in the future.<br>​<br></li></ol><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Even if you've been wrongly accused of something, you should still show you&#160;understand the&#160;other person's frustration,&#160;and demonstrate&#160;initiative.&#160;Always have a view to the future and the big picture.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><b>Important&#58;</b>&#160;When wrongly accused of something, most people get stuck on defending themselves, and never take any ownership of the problem or bother to try to fix it for the future. They then seem more interested in justifying themselves or explaining their reasoning, than actually fixing the problem.&#160;​<br></p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/dilbert-criticism-1.gif" alt="dilbert-criticism-1.gif" /><br></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Make sure you know how to take criticism well<br></dd></dl><div><div><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Video​<br></h3>
