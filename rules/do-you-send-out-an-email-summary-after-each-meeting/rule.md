After a meeting, you should summarise the main issues and decisions of the meeting, generating actionable tasks and delegating them to the proper person. ​The level of detail in the communication should suit the type of meeting, but should at least include a bullet point list of agenda items or any announcements made at the meeting.

This can also be used as a reference for those who did attend the meeting.​
