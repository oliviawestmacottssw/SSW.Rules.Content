<p>​​Managers (or clients), like all of us, are snowed under with work and won't always be able to respond to your emails in a timely manner. But keeping a good line of communication open is essential and it's up to you to make it happen. No matter that your weekly meeting gets cancelled, or your client&#160;appears to avoid you for the week, stop and talk to them in the corridor, or pick up the phone and give them an update.​ </p>
<p>If you know you've got issues to discuss (such as looming deadlines), don't wait for the client or your manager to bring it up, take a pro-active approach and schedule a meeting.</p>

<p>As a guideline you should not go more than 2 weeks without talking to your boss. And don't forget all the things you've got to say - have a sub-folder in your Inbox such as &quot;Ask the Boss&quot;. Next time when the boss asks &quot;does anyone want to speak to me?&quot;, look in that folder.</p>
                <dl class="bad">
                    <dt>What do you mean?<br><br>
                    Uly</dt>

                    Uly</dt>
                    <dd>Figure&#58; OK example - calling, then bouncing emails back</dd>

                <dl class="good">
                    <dt>(I called you and left a message as I need clarification - so have moved it to 'Ask the boss')<br>

                    Will catch you later about it<br><br>
