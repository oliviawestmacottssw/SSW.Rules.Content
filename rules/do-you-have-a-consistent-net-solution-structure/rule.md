<p>When developing software, we follow a standard solution structure.</p>

   <strong>[Company].[AssemblyName]</strong>. E.g. 
   <strong>BCE.Logging</strong> is a shared project between all solutions at company BCE.</p><p>Other projects are named

   <strong>BCE.Sparrow.Business</strong> is the Business layer assembly for company ‘BCE’, solution ‘Sparrow’.</p><p>We have separated the unit tests, one for each project, for several reasons&#58;</p><ul><li>It provides a clear separation of concerns and allows each component to be individually tested</li><li>The different libraries can be used on other projects with confidence as there are a set of tests around them</li></ul>
