<p>The repository pattern is a great way to handle your data access layer and should be used wherever you have a need to retrieve data and turn it into domain objects.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>The advantages of using a repository pattern are&#58;</p>
<ul><li>Abstraction away from the detail of how objects are retrieved and saved</li>
<li>Domain objects are ignorant of persistence - persistence is handled completely by the repository</li>
<li>Testability of your code without having to hit the database (you can just mock the repository)</li>
<li>Reusability of data access code without having to worry about consistency</li></ul>
<p>Even better, by providing a consistent repository base class, you can get all your CRUD operations while avoiding any plumbing code.</p>
