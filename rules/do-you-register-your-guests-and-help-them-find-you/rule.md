<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Your event must have a registration area clearly signed and easily identifiable.&#160;​​</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Further, your registration process should be efficient and simple. What has worked well at DDD Melbourne is</p><ul><li>Have enough people ready for registration first thing in the morning. More is more.</li><li>Be able to find individual name tags and/or welcome packages quickly. Sorting alphabetically could be useful.</li><li>Have a clear entry and exit so people aren't creating a bottleneck</li><li>Use only electronic registration (apps and devices) where it improves the speed of the process.</li></ul><p>Attendees will go to the registration area to register (if applicable) and they will go here to have any questions answered as well. A registration area should be </p><ul><li>Clearly visible – Put up adequate signage and announce where the​ area is</li><li>Always manned – registration should have permanent staff there to help any attendees that require it at any time</li><li>Be at a central location, but not in the way of where people are walking</li></ul>
