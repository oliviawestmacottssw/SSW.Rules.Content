<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​Arriving at a venue for the first time can be both&#160;confusing and daunting if you don't know the area. Your event should&#160;have a registration area clearly signposted&#160;and easily identifiable so that your guests can find you more easily.&#160;<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Your registration process should be efficient and simple. What has worked well at DDD Melbourne is&#58;<br></p><ul><li>Have enough people ready for registration first thing in the morning. More is more.</li><li>Be able to find individual name tags and/or welcome packages quickly. Sorting alphabetically could be useful.</li><li>Have a clear entry and exit so people aren't creating a bottleneck</li><li>Use only electronic registration where possible. Eventbrite has an app linked to your account that will drastically&#160;speed up&#160;the process. So use an app where possible.<br></li></ul><p>Attendees will go to the registration area to register (if applicable) and they will go here to have any questions answered as well. A registration area should be&#58;<br></p><ul><li>Clearly visible – Put up adequate signage and announce where the​ area is<br></li><li>Always manned – registration should have permanent staff there to help any attendees that require it at any time<br></li><li>Brand your staff using company t-shirts, this will help people identify helpers immediately​.<br></li><li>Be at a central location, but not in the way of where people are walking<br></li></ul>
