This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <div class="greyBox">Mary, I need you to send me your database schema as it might be different from what it should be. Can you&#58;<br>
<ol>
    <li>Open up Enterprise Manager in you are on SQL 2000 (or open SQL Management Studio if you are on SQL 2005, 2008 or 2010) </li>
    <li>Open the first tree </li>
    <li>Open the second tree </li>
    <li>Select your server </li>
    <li>Open that tree </li>
    <li>Select Databases </li>
    <li>Open that tree </li>
    <li>Select the database called Northwind </li>
    <li>Right click it and choose All Tasks, then <b>Generate SQL Script</b> </li>
    <li>Then select the options </li>
    <li>etc </li>
    <li>Then when I get this I will compare and I will make a script file for you to run and fix the problem </li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>STOP! STOP! STOP!<br>
It would be much better to just say&#58;</p>
<blockquote><i>Mary, click the &quot;Reconcile&quot; button and it will tell us what is wrong</i></blockquote>
<p>Bottom line is the customers' database schema should always be correct, should be managed automatically by the app and if it is not, it is their problem.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should deliver an application with the buttons &quot;Create&quot;, Upgrade&quot; and &quot;Reconcile&quot;, accessible via &quot;Tools - Options&quot; and a &quot;Database&quot; tab. We do this by using SSW SQL Deploy and throwing on the inherited user-control from the SSW.SQLDeploy.Options project.</p>
<p>For more information see <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/SQLservertools.aspx#SQLDeploy">Best Tools for SQL Server</a></p>
It looks like this<br>

This compares the current scripts, to the client's database and tells you if things are not right</span> <img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="New database dialog" src="/Standards/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSQLServerSchemaDeployment/PublishingImages/NewDatabaseDialog.jpg" /> <span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; First time your client opens the application, they will need to Creating a database. It should be as easy as clicking &quot;Create&quot;</span>
<div class="greyBox">As a developer, I promise to do these 3 things&#58;
<ol>
    <li>Save every SQL change I do as a script </li>
    <li>Make sure the application I develop, has 3 buttons, &quot;Create&quot;, &quot;Update&quot; and &quot;Reconcile&quot; </li>
    <li>Never ask a client to run a script </li>
</ol>
