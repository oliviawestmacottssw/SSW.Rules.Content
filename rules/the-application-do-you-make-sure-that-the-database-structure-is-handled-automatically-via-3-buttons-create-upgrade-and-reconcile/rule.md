  <p>You get an error message reported from a user like: </p>
<blockquote><i>    When I click the Save button on the product form it gives an error message about a missing field.</i></blockquote>

<p>You try and reproduce it on your version in the office and everything works perfectly.<br>
<br>
You suspect that the customer probably has changed the schema. So you start drafting an email to the user like: </p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <div class="greyBox">Mary, I need you to send me your database schema as it might be different from what it should be. Can you:<br>
<ol>
    <li>Open up Enterprise Manager in you are on SQL 2000 (or open SQL Management Studio if you are on SQL 2005, 2008 or 2010) </li>
    <li>Open the first tree </li>
    <li>Open the second tree </li>
    <li>Select your server </li>
    <li>Open that tree </li>
    <li>Select Databases </li>
    <li>Open that tree </li>
    <li>Select the database called Northwind </li>
    <li>Right click it and choose All Tasks, then <b>Generate SQL Script</b> </li>
    <li>Then select the options </li>
    <li>etc </li>
    <li>Then when I get this I will compare and I will make a script file for you to run and fix the problem </li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>STOP! STOP! STOP!<br>
It would be much better to just say:</p>
<blockquote><i>Mary, click the "Reconcile" button and it will tell us what is wrong</i></blockquote>
<p>Bottom line is the customers' database schema should always be correct, should be managed automatically by the app and if it is not, it is their problem.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should deliver an application with the buttons "Create", Upgrade" and "Reconcile", accessible via "Tools - Options" and a "Database" tab. We do this by using SSW SQL Deploy and throwing on the inherited user-control from the SSW.SQLDeploy.Options project.</p>
<p>For more information see <a href="http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/SQLservertools.aspx#SQLDeploy">Best Tools for SQL Server</a></p>
It looks like this<br>
<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Reconcile" src="Reconcile.jpg" /> <span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure: When weird errors are happening at a client, you need a "Reconcile" button in your application. This compares the current scripts, to the client's database and tells you if things are not right</span> <img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="New database dialog" src="NewDatabaseDialog.jpg" /> <span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure: First time your client opens the application, they will need to Creating a database. It should be as easy as clicking "Create"</span>
<div class="greyBox">As a developer, I promise to do these 3 things:
<ol>
    <li>Save every SQL change I do as a script </li>
    <li>Make sure the application I develop, has 3 buttons, "Create", "Update" and "Reconcile" </li>
    <li>Never ask a client to run a script </li>
</ol>
