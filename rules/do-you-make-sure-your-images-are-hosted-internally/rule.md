When want to show an image from the web on your website, the easiest way is to just copy the image's path and add it. This is not a good idea as the original host of the image can delete it, which will cause a broken image in your website.<br>

<p>The right way to do this is to copy the image locally and upload to your own server, so you have total control over the image.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-CodeArea">&lt;dl class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;<br>&lt;dt&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;<span class="ssw15-rteStyle-Highlight">https&#58;//some-external-​url.com</span>/images/open-extension.png&quot; alt=&quot;Open extension&quot; /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&#160;<br>&lt;dd&gt;Figure&#58; Open extension&lt;/dd&gt;<br>&lt;/dl&gt;<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">​Figure&#58; Bad example - using an external URL as image source.
