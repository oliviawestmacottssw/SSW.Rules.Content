In every Windows application project, we need to have a main, start-up or wizard page<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:11pt;font-family:'calibri','sans-serif';"> </span> form for a better structure and design.

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
  <img src="BadMainForm.gif" alt="Bad Project without Main Form" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" /> <span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Bad example - The entry form is not immediately recognizable because of a non standard name </span><img src="GoodMainForm.gif" alt="Good with Main Form" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" /> <span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Good example - The entry form follows the naming convention rule </span>
<table summary="Code Auditor" class="clsSSWProductTable">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>We have a program called <a href="http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Default.aspx#VBMainForm">SSW Code Auditor</a> to check for this rule.
            <p>Note: In Code Auditor we check for Form named: Startup, MainForm and WizardPage.</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
