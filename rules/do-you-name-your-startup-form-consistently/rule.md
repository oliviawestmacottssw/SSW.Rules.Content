In every Windows application project. We need to have a main form for a better structure and design. 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Bad Project without Main Form" src="/Standards/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterDotNETProjects/PublishingImages/BadMainForm.gif" /> <span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Bad example - The entry form is not immediately recognizable because of a non standard name </span><img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Good with Main Form" src="/Standards/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterDotNETProjects/PublishingImages/GoodMainForm.gif" /> <span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Good example - The entry form follows the naming convention rule </span>
<table class="clsSSWProductTable" summary="Code Auditor">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>We have a program called <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Default.aspx#VBMainForm">SSW Code Auditor</a> to check for this rule.
            <p>Note&#58; In Code Auditor we check for Form named&#58; Startup, MainService, MainForm and WizardPage.</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
