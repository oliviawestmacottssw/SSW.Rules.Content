<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​A lot of people talk about appointments and plan to do it later. E.g. you’re at the dentist and they give you a card with your next visit’s time written on it. People take the card and plan to enter it into their calendar later.​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>A better way is to stop, pull out your phone, and enter it immediately before leaving the dentist.</p><p>Similarly, you might be on the phone with a client and arrange a date and plan to enter it in later. A better way is to say “Hang on a second while I shoot you an appointment for the time.”</p><p>Locking in time as soon as possible is a big efficiency, and helps to avoid any possible mistakes or double bookings.</p><p>As soon as you know you’ll need time with someone, create and send the appointment immediately.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/ssw-do-it-now.jpg" alt="ssw-do-it-now.jpg" /></dt></dl>
