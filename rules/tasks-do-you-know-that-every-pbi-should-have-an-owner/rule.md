<div style="display&#58;inline;"><div>During a sprint it can be useful for&#58;</div>
<ul><li>The Product Owner to know who to speak to regarding a User Story.</li>
<li>The Team to know who will be presenting the User Story at the Sprint Review</li></ul>
<div>In order to achieve this, one of the Team can choose to be the primary contact for the user story. </div>
<div><br>Beware, this is intended for convenience and should not conflict with the following Scrum principals from page 6 of the <a href="/Pages/Scrumguide.aspx">Scrum Guide</a></div>
<ul><li>The Development team is self-organising.</li>
<li>Accountability belongs to the development team as a whole&#160;</li></ul></div>
