<p>​Authentication and authorisation are complicated, and it is risky&#160;to try and implement it yourself.&#160; Use this rule for a guide on choosing the right service or framework for your situation.​​<br></p><dl class="image"><dt>​<img src="/PublishingImages/security-icon-ssw.jpg" alt="security-icon-ssw.jpg" style="width&#58;80px;height&#58;80px;" />​<br></dt></dl>

   <a href="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0d9iTmWIOw">authentication and authorisation</a> approach for your situation can be tricky. It is a multi-facted problem with many variables, and what seems like the right choice in one situation may not be in the other.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Start by asking the following questions about your application&#58;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"> 
   <br> 
</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"></p><ol><li>Is it an enterprise application for internal user&#160;or a consumer application for externaluse?<br></li><li>Do you need to support

   <strong>TIP</strong>&#58; Consider other factors too when making your decision, e.g. cost, potential crossover scenarios, etc.<br></p><h3>ASP.NET Core Identity (simple and free)<br></h3><p>ASP.NET Core has some built in identity functionality that allows you to create users and roles, and manage the security of your web applications. It is extremely capable and can be used to support a broad number of scenarios. However, it is intended for use in simple web applications, and while it can be extended to support other clients, you will need to build and wire up a lot of the UI for these scenarios yourself. Your identity store will be limited to this one application, so your users will not be able to users to share this identity across multiple applications.</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood"> Advantages​​&#58;<br></dd><ul><li></li><li>Free</li><li>Easy to set up and use</li><li>Supports OAuth2/OICD providers</li></ul><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad"> Disadvantages​​&#58;<br></dd><p></p><p>Not recommended (by Microsoft) for anything other than simple ASP.NET Core web applications</p><p>Does not scale well across multiple applications</p><p>No included MFA</p><p>For anything other than an ASP.NET Core Web app, you have to build all UI yourself&#58;</p><ul><ul><li>Sign up<br></li><li>Log in</li><li>Password reset</li><li>Etc<br></li></ul></ul><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><strong>Use this option if...</strong>&#160;you need to add identity to a simple application. You can support additional clients (e.g. SPA or mobile) however you will need to wire up a lot of the functionality yourself, which means if vulnerabilities are discovered for your scenario you will need to fix these yourself.​<br><br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3" style="background-color&#58;initial;">​Identity Server (full control)</h3><p> 
   <a href="https&#58;//identityserver.io/">Identity Server 4</a>&#160;is a free and open source solution that is built on top of ASP.NET Core Identity.

Many organisations already have AD as it provides a lot of additional capability and is integrated with most of their existing enterprise applications. AD supports multiple authentication protocols, including&#58;&#160;<br></p><ul><li>LDAP/LDAPS&#58; simple to use but old tech, requires multiple queries to check permissions, roles not natively supported and need to be managed by groups.</li><li>Kerberos&#58; Excellent experience for users as it provides a silent and transparent login. But is a difficult and complex protocol not well understood by many developers and requires complex and difficult setup for both the devs and the sysadmins.<br></li><li>ADFS/SAML&#58; Modern application authentication against AD is done via ADFS with SAML. This is often extended through third party tools such as Okta to support applications that use JWT and claims.<br></li><li>Proprietary Microsoft&#58; Basic, NTLM etc.​<br></li></ul><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​​Advantages<br></dd><ul class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><li>​​Already in place in most enterprise organisations</li><li>Users do not require an additional identity</li><li>Can make the application compliant with the organisation's existing security policies​<br></li></ul><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">​Disadvantages<br></dd><ul class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><li>​​Not suited to external use</li><li>Can require a lot of setup to work well with company RBAC (e.g. AD groups for authorisation)</li><li>Will require significant developer work to make application roles work with AD groups (if required)</li><li>Not natively supported off-premises​</li><li>No MFA included<br></li></ul><div>
