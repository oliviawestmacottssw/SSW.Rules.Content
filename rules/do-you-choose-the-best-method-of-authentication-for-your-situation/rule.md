<p>​​​Authentication and authorisation are complicated, and it is risky to try and implement it yourself.  Use this rule for a guide on choosing the right service or framework for your situation.​​<br></p><dl class="image"><dt>​<img src="security-icon-ssw.jpg" alt="security-icon-ssw.jpg" style="width:80px;height:80px;" />​​<br></dt></dl>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​Choosing the right 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0d9iTmWIOw">authentication and authorisation</a> approach for your situation can be tricky. It is a multi-facted problem with many variables, and what seems like the right choice in one situation may not be in the other.<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Start with the Questions​​<br></h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"></p><ol><li>Scope - Is it an enterprise application for internal user or a consumer application for external use?<br></li><li>Social - Do you need to support

   <b>Example Template to Customer​:</b><br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"> 
   <strong>Scenario:</strong><br>Scope - You are building a consumer facing service that will have multiple clients, including a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2013/november/asp-net-single-page-applications-build-modern-responsive-web-apps-with-asp-net">SPA​</a> and a mobile app. 
   <br>Social - You want to allow your users to sign up with their social identities (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) but want to allow them to create an account with you if they don't have a social login or don't want to use it. 
   <br>All users will have the same level of access once logged in. 
   <br>Volume - You anticipate 20,000 active users. 
   <br>MFA - You would like to allow users to enable MFA. 
   <br><br><strong>Your choices:</strong><br><b>Option A </b><span class="ssw15-rteStyle-Highlight">(Recommended)</span> - Azure AD B2C<b></b> - B2C provides all of the functionality you need and is free for up to 50,000 monthly users.<b></b><br><b>Option B</b> - Auth0<b></b> - Auth0 will meet most of these requirements, however your volume of users will exceed the free tier and you don't need the additional functionality of the paid tier. 
   <br> 
   <strong>Option C</strong> - Identity Server 
   <b></b>- This would work but as it doesn't include MFA this would need to be provided via an additional service. Also due to your expected volume of users you would need to manage scaling for this yourself.<br> ​ </p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">

   <strong>Example Template to Customer:</strong><br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"> 
   <strong>Scenario:</strong><br>Scope - You have an internal enterprise application, which will support approximately 1,000 users. 
   <br>You already have Active Directory in place, and are syncing with an Azure AD tenant. 
   <br>Your users will need to access this application from anywhere. 
   <br>MFA - As per your company security policy, you must enforce MFA. 
   <br><br><strong>Your choices:</strong><br><strong class="ssw15-rteStyle-Highlight"></strong><b>Option A</b> <span class="ssw15-rteStyle-Highlight">(Recommended)</span> - ​Azure Active Directory - most of the infrastructure for this is already in place for you, and it already meets all your requirements.

<div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Note #1</strong>: All of the following options assume you are building an ASP.NET Core application, although the commercial options listed here provide libraries for most development languages, frameworks and platforms.<br><br><strong>Note #2</strong>: The information here is relevant as provided, but consider other factors that may impact your decision too. For example, cost may be a factor and saving money may be more important than the added benefits of higher cost options. Additionally, your situation may not fit neatly into one of the scenarios we have listed and may span multiple scenarios, in which case you may need to pick the option which caters to the broadest set of requirements (avoid 'mix and match').<br></div><div><br></div><br> 
<h3>ASP.NET Core Identity (simple and free)<br></h3><p>ASP.NET Core has some built in identity functionality that allows you to create users and roles, and manage the security of your web applications. It is extremely capable and can be used to support a broad number of scenarios. However, it is intended for use in simple web applications, and while it can be extended to support other clients, you will need to build and wire up a lot of the UI for these scenarios yourself. Your identity store will be limited to this one application, so your users will not be able to share this identity across multiple applications.<br><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood"> Advantages​​:<br></dd><ul><li></li><li>Free</li><li>Easy to set up and use</li><li>Supports OAuth2/OIDC providers</li></ul><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad"> Disadvantages​​:<br></dd><p></p><ul><li>It is recommended by Microsoft that for advanced requirements you don't use this on its own - so need to add one of the below</li><li>Does not scale well across multiple applications - so need to add one of the below<br></li><li>For anything other than an ASP.NET Core Web app (e.g. Angular, React or mobile), you have to build all UI yourself, such as: <span style="background-color:initial;">sign up, l</span><span style="background-color:initial;">og, p</span><span style="background-color:initial;">assword reset, e</span><span style="background-color:initial;">tc.</span></li></ul><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">

Many organisations already have AD as it provides a lot of additional capability and is integrated with most of their existing enterprise applications. AD supports multiple authentication protocols, including: <br></p><ul><li>LDAP/LDAPS: simple to use but old tech, requires multiple queries to check permissions, roles not natively supported and need to be managed by groups.</li><li>Kerberos: Excellent experience for users as it provides a silent and transparent login. But is a difficult and complex protocol not well understood by many developers and requires complex and difficult setup for both the devs and the sysadmins.<br></li><li>ADFS/SAML: Modern application authentication against AD is done via ADFS with SAML. This is often extended through third party tools such as Okta to support applications that use JWT and claims.<br></li><li>Proprietary Microsoft: Basic, NTLM etc.​<br></li></ul><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​​Advantages<br></dd><ul class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><li>​​Already in place in most enterprise organisations</li><li>Users do not require an additional identity</li><li>Can make the application compliant with the organisation's existing security policies​<br></li></ul><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">​Disadvantages<br></dd><ul class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><li>​​Not suited to external use</li><li>Can require a lot of setup to work well with company RBAC (e.g. AD groups for authorisation)</li><li>Will require significant developer work to make application roles work with AD groups (if required)</li><li>Not natively supported off-premises​</li><li>No MFA included<br></li></ul><div>

Azure AD is different in that it is fundamentally identity only (it doesn't provide endpoint and user management features such as Group Policy) and as such provides strong identity features not natively supported by AD, such as MFA and self-service password recovery. Being cloud based, it can authenticate users anywhere in the world (rather than just on-premises on corporate computers).​<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​​Advantages<br></dd><ul class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><li>​​​Many organisations already have AAD</li><li>Extends existing enterprise identity to the cloud (i.e. is supported off-premises)</li><li>Can be used to ensure compliance with existing company security policies</li><li>MFA support included​<br></li></ul><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">​Disadvantages<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"></p><ul><li>​Not suited for external or consumer facing uses</li></ul>
