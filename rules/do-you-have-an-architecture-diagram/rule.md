<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​A good architecture diagram gives a great overview of your project to new developers coming onto your project, or even existing developers who have been focused on a specific feature for a long time.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">An architecture diagram lets you see at a glance what the overall structure of the solution is. This is useful for gaining an understanding of how the system fits together, how it works, and what it does. It also helps to easily show which components can be improved due to updated or better components (or improved architectural guidelines).<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">An architecture diagram is usefule when&#58;<br></p><ul class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><li>You are onboarding a new developer</li><li>You have been deep into one aspect of the system and need a refresher on another area</li><li>You have been off the project for a while<br></li></ul><p>The architecture diagram is a technical document that demonstrates the technology in use. The purpose of the architecure diagram is to show how a solution has been built and what the technical dependencies are. It is not used for user journeys or business logic.<br></p><dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/architecture-diagram-bad.png" alt="architecture-diagram-bad.png" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - a sequence diagram doesn't give any indication of how the solution has been built.

If it adds value to your documentation (i.e., there is a specific reason to include it) yo can include the .NET dependency diagram, but don't use it here in place of the architecture diagram.<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/SiteAssets/have-an-architecture-diagram/dependency-validation-01.png" alt="dependency-validation-01.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;600px;height&#58;360px;" /></dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">​Figure&#58; Bad Example - the .NET dependency diagram shows code dependencies, but not the application's architecture<br></dd><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​​​Tip 2&#58; Show data dependencies and data flows<br></h3>Your architecture digram should show how the components of your solution fit together. It should also show how the components of the architecture depend on each other for functionality, as well as upstream and downstream data dependencies.<br></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/architecture-diagram-good1.png" alt="architecture-diagram-good1.png" style="width&#58;750px;" /><br></dt><dd>Figure&#58; OK&#160;Example - Shows the technologies and data flows.&#160;Gives an overview of the whole application in one diagram.<br></dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​Tip 3&#58; Put data at the top<br></h3><p>​​It should be easy to tell at a glance which direction data flows in your diagram&#58;&#160;left to right, right to left, <span class="ssw15-rteStyle-Highlight">top to bottom </span>(recommended). Pick a direction for your data flow, and keep it consistent across all your documentation. Where there are exceptions (for example data going to analytics or to/from partner sources) make these perpendicular to the primary data flow direction.<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/SiteAssets/have-an-architecture-diagram/sugarlearning-architecture-diagram.png" alt="sugarlearning-architecture-diagram.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;600px;height&#58;636px;" /></dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​Figure&#58; Good example - data flows from top to bottom, with exceptions (e.g. App Insights / Raygun, not part of the main data flow) perpendicular to the primary direction<br></dd><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Tip 4&#58; Keep everything consistent​</h3><p>​All your icons should be the same size. All text should use the same typeface and font size. Keep other things consistent too - arrow heads, lines, colors and iconography.​​​​​​</p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><br><img src="/SiteAssets/have-an-architecture-diagram/rewards-architecture-diagram.png" alt="rewards-architecture-diagram.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;600px;height&#58;652px;" /></dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good example - consistent styling is used, e.g. as well as all the icons and typography being consistent,&#160;you can see that data is a solid line and auth traffic is a dotted line<br></dd><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​​​Tip 5&#58; Use the right tools<br></h3><p>TODO&#58; Add paper sketch<br></p><p>TODO&#58; Add timepro<br></p><p>TODO&#58; Add SSW.People<br></p><p>​The best tool for creating these diagrams is <a href="https&#58;//diagrams.net/">diagrams.net​</a> (previously draw.io). Better still, if you're using VS Code, you can use a diagrams.net extension so that you can create and edit diagrams right there in your project, and check them into your repository with your code.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-SSW-Only">​TODO&#58; Include screenshot from William<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><br></p></dl>
