<p>Some clients think that a Project Manager is just a resource that increases the cost of a project. But a house does not get built if you leave the architect, carpenters, electricians and plumbers to just work it out between themselves. The house *does* get built if the foreman is keeping everyone on their toes, making sure they are doing their job.&#160;&#160;​</p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify s4-wpActive">

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>It's generally best for the Scrum Master *not* to be a member of the development team. This way they can stay objective and it creates more of a ceremony when they turn up.</p><p><strong>Tip&#58;</strong> If they are trying to be a member of the development team and a Scrum Master, call them a 'Semi Scrum Master&quot; as they often don't do as good a job.</p>
<p>Here is a common way a project goes with a Scrum Master involved&#58;</p><ul><li>The sprint backlog is approved by the Product Owner (the customer)</li><li>The Development team works on the sprint backlog (usually 2 weeks)... The Scrum Master is ensuring the client is kept up-to-date (via the Review, Retro and Planning meetings) #1</li><li>The Scrum Master is ensuring the client is kept up-to-date (via the 4 reports) </li><li>The Account Manager is booking in future sprints (after the Planning Meeting)</li><li>The Account Manager invoices (usually every week).</li></ul><p>This is much better than the old waterfall method which goes like this&#58;</p><ul><li>The specification is approved by the customer</li><li>The Development team is working to the specifications for some months&#160;(but can be from anywhere from 2 months to 2 years)</li><li>The Project Manager is ensuring the client is kept up-to-date (via ad hoc meetings)</li><li>The Account Manager sends invoices when milestones are met.<br></li></ul><p>Insist that your Scrum Master (aka Project Manager)&#160;<a href="/does-your-scrum-master-(aka-project-manager)-maintain-a-strict-project-schedule">maintains a strict project schedule</a>. </p><div class="scrum-GreyBox"><p>
