Capturing video from your mac can be done in different ways. One way is to use software that will capture the screen, and create a file that you can use in your editing software. The other is to use hardware capture that connects to the video output (i.e. HDMI) of your mac. This rule will focus on capturing&#160;video via hardware.

<p class="p1">At SSW, we use HDMI capture cards to record the video from a presenters’ laptop into our workstation. This video is then either recorded for later editing or used as part of the Live Stream.</p><p class="p2"><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">PC’s will have no issues when connecting to the system. Outputting via HDMI, VGA or Display Port, you can connect directly or convert these connections via a splitter/scaler device.</span><br></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">*Pic of Device*</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">Mac’s however run into a issue with copy protection when outputting via a digital connection.</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">*Pic of HDCP*</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">If connecting a MAC via a digital connection, you will see the above message in XSplit (and any other similar streaming/capture software).</p><p class="p2"><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">To overcome this, you need to convert the signal to VGA (analogue), which will strip out the HDCP protection.</span><br></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">*Pic of VGA adapter*</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">The second issue with this scenario is that the HDMI capture card in the workstation will not except a VGA signal.
