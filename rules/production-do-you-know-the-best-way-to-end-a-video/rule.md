<p>​The ending of your video should contain a <a href="/Pages/Adding-a-call-to-action.aspx">call to action</a>, the logo of your company and a sign off from the speaker(s).</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>In an interview situation the best way to sign off is to try and lead from the subject matter to the end of the video smoothly.</p><p>In a lecture the best way is to finish is the same way the speaker would end a normal lecture. Something along the lines of &quot;Well that's it guys, if you want to get a copy of the slides you can download them at [] and be sure to subscribe to my posts on Twitter&quot;. Then proceed with the standard call to action and the company logo.</p><div class="ssw-rteStyle-GreyBox">&quot;This is Adam Cogan signing off until next time&quot; (grins at camera with a thumbs up)</div>
<span class="ssw-rteStyle-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad example – impersonal, cheesy and uninformative sign off</span>
<div class="ssw-rteStyle-GreyBox"><p>Interviewer (Adam)&#58; 
      <br>&quot;Well that’s all great stuff Joe and we're looking forward to seeing your new software soon&quot; 
      <br></p><p>Interviewee (Joe)&#58; 
      <br>&quot;Thanks Adam&quot;​​<br></p></div>
<span class="ssw-rteStyle-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good example – personal, the speakers relate to each other well, refers to subject matter in the video​</span>
