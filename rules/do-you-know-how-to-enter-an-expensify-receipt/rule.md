Expensify is great for tracking receipts, but if you don't use it in&#160;the right way the reports can be hard to reconcile.<br><div><br></div><div>To avoid confusion, add as much detail as possible about the purchase and who authorised it. To make this easier, your company can set required entry&#160;fields to ensure that you have all of the relevant data for each claim.<br></div>

There is still room to add a comment for more complicated claims if required.<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">If you complete these fields, it will make your reports much nicer to read and easier to claim.<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/SiteAssets/how-to-enter-an-expensify-receipt/Expensify%20example%20categories.png" alt="Expensify example categories.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;700px;height&#58;612px;" /></dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good example - You can see highlighted here that the expenses have been sorted by &quot;Category&quot; and that they have all of the relevant information to claim. A&#160;Date,&quot;&#160;&quot;Name of Merchant,&quot; and what the expense was for is clearly identified and you can also see each has an&#160;attached&#160;receipt. You can also see in one example that&#160;an additional&#160;&quot;Comment&quot;&#160;has been added to a more complicated expense to reflect the approval for that purhase.<br></dd></dl>
