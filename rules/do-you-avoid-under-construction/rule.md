<p>If all you have time to ftp up is a couple of simple html pages with few contact
    details and a brief &quot;About Us&quot;, then leave it as that. Writing &quot;Under Construction&quot;
    says &quot;We have a few ideas, but we really just don't have the resources to get our
    website together at the moment.&quot; Bad idea.
