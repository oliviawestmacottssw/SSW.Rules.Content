### Option 1: External tool (not recommended)


Using NUnit with Visual Studio: To make it easy to use, you need to add it as an external tool in Visual Studio.

In Visual Studio:

1. Go to Tools > External Tools
2. Click "Add" button
3. Type in:


* Title: NUnit GUI
* Command: Location of nUnit.exe file
* Argument: /run (so that the tests run automatically when started)
* Initial Directory: $(Target directory)

### Option 2: Test Driven .net


TestDriven.net has better NUnit integration – from both code and Solution Explorer windows.

To run unit testing: Tools > NUnit GUI to launch NUnit and run the tests.

### Option 3: Other Tools


Other Visual Studio tools including Resharper and Coderush have their own integration with NUnit. If you’re already using one of these, installing TestDriven.net is unnecessary.
