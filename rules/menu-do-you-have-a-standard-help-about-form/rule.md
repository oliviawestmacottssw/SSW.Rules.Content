<div>Every application you build should have the same "Help | About" form. The form should always display the following information:</div>
<ol><li>Version number</li>
<li>URL</li>
<li>Description of the product and what it does.<br>Tip: This should be consistent with your standard description on the product box, website homepage, product page etc. </li>
<li>Contact details (especially a phone number)</li>
<li>Branding (logo)</li></ol>
