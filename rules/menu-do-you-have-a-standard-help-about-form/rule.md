Every application you build should have the same "Help | About" form. The form should always display the following information:

1. Version number
2. URL
3. Description of the product and what it does.
Tip: This should be consistent with your standard description on the product box, website homepage, product page etc.
4. Contact details (especially a phone number)
5. Branding (logo)
