<p>​Often you will receive rich information from your Product Owner (Customer) about tasks. That information can be in the form of Word documents, HTML Emails and Pictures, but you generally receive them in the context of an Email. This should be done by one person called the scribe.​</p>

You can attach this content manually, but it can be time consuming.</p><p>
