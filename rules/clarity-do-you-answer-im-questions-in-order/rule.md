<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Sometimes people fire a few questions at you and the tendency is to answer the last question first. A clear approach if you receive more than 1&#160;question in an IM chat, is to answer each question&#160;in order, keeping the conversation is clearer. It's also a good idea to repeat the keywords of each question in your answer so there is no chance of confusion.<br></p>
