   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: If you are serious about your blog and including content on it, you should configure a paid Azure Add-on to host your MySQL Database  when you set it up</dd></dl><dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;

   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: If you have already created your blog, navigate to your Web Site within the Azure portal, select Linked Resources, select the line for the MySQL Database and click the Manage link. This will open the ClearDb portal. Go to the Dashboard and click Upgrade</dd></dl> References:  [John Papa: Tips for WordPress on Azure](http://www.johnpapa.net/azurecleardbmysql/)
