<p>Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) lets you easily apply network settings to a Hyper-V host or cluster.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>â€‹Instead of managing each Virtual Machine network itself, using VMM to manage them all is much easier.</p><p>To do that, you need to complete a few steps&#58;</p><p>&#160; 1. Configure network settings with a logical switch;</p><p>You can learn more on how to set this up <a href="https&#58;//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/vmm/network-switch?view=sc-vmm-2019">here</a>.<br><br>&#160; 2. Ask yourself&#58; &quot;What is this network adapter going to be used for?&quot;</p><p>You need to specify if the network adapter is going to be used for virtual machines, host management, etc...</p><p>&#160; 3. Apply the logical switch and monitor physical network devices</p><p>For full instructions on how to do this, see <a href="https&#58;//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/vmm/hyper-v-network?view=sc-vmm-2019">here</a>.<br></p>
