<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ol class="ol1"><li class="li1">Are you happy with the training provided?</li><li class="li1">What did the trainer do well?</li><li class="li1">What could the trainer improve?</li><li class="li1">Did you learn what you expected to learn?</li><li class="li1">Would you recommend SSW?</li><li class="li1">Do you need help with anything else?</li></ol><p class="p1"><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">After you complete the interview send an “as per our conversation email” to the client and CC the trainer.
