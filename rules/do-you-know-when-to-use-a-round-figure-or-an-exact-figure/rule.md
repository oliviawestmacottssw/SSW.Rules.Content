The number you give to a client says a lot about how much room there is to move.&#160;Knowing the difference and when to use them can be a valuable tool in securing projects.<br>
<br>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>For a 
   <strong>fixed price </strong>project, exact figures should be used. This makes sure there is no ambiguity between what the client is thinking and what you are thinking.</p><p>A round figure gives the impression that it was just plucked out of thin air and you can go lower.&#160;</p>
<font class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox">The project will take about 6&#160;months to complete and cost $200,000+GST</font><br><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Bad Example - You've just made that number up, you can go lower​</font>
<p> An exact figure gives the impression that you've done your research and there isn't as much room to move.</p>
<font class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox">The project will take 6 months to complete and cost $204,080+GST</font><br><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Good Example - Everyone knows exactly what they're in for<br> </font>
<p> For a<strong> variable price </strong>project, round figures should be used. This gives room for the project scope to be varied with additional items and lends itself more to an agile approach.</p>
<font class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox">The project will take ​6 months to complete and cost $204,080+GST</font><br><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Bad Example - This makes it very hard to vary the project as the client will always have this figure in mind<br> </font> 
<br> A round figure gives the impression that this is a ball park estimate and that the price will likely change.&#160;<br><font class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox">The project will take about 6&#160;months to complete and cost $200,000+GST</font><br><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Good Example - Give the client an indication of how much it will approximately cost without committing to the figure</font><br>
