​The number you give to a client says a lot about how much room there is to move.&#160;Knowing the difference and when to use them can be a valuable tool in securing projects.<br>
<br>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>For a 
<span style="color&#58;#ff0000;">   </span><strong><span style="color&#58;#ff0000;">fixed price</span> </strong>project, exact figures should be used. This makes sure there is no ambiguity between what the client is thinking and what you are thinking.<br></p><p>A round figure gives the impression that it was just plucked out of thin air and you can go lower.&#160;<br></p><p><strong>Note</strong><strong>&#58;&#160;</strong>Whether round or exact, ​<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=b1426257-e3df-404a-a6a8-4d257f5439a2">make sure your dollar amount is excluding GST, and has &quot;+GST&quot; after it</a>.​<br></p>
<font class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox">The project will take about 6&#160;months to complete and cost $200,000+GST</font><br><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Bad Example - You've just made that number up, you can go lower​</font>
<p> An exact figure gives the impression that you've done your research and there isn't as much room to move.</p>
<font class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox">The project will take 6 months to complete and cost $204,080+GST</font><br><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Good Example - Everyone knows exactly what they're in for<br> </font>
<p> For a<strong style="color&#58;#ff0000;"> <span style="color&#58;#ff0000;">variable price</span> </strong>project, round figures should be used. This gives room for the project scope to be varied with additional items and lends itself more to an agile approach.</p>
<font class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox">The project will take ​6 months to complete and cost $204,080+GST</font><br><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Bad Example - This makes it very hard to vary the project as the client will always have this figure in mind<br> </font> 
<br> A round figure gives the impression that this is a ball park estimate and that the price will likely change.&#160;<br><font class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox">The project will take about 6&#160;months to complete and cost approximately $200,000+GST</font><br><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Good Example - Give the client an indication of how much it will approximately cost without committing to the figure</font><br>
