<p>Every email you process takes time. Sifting through unnecessary emails becomes really frustrating. Don't clog up someone else's Inbox with unnecessary emails. </p>
<p>A good rule of thumb for whether an email is unnecessary is if your email comprises of less than 5 words (e.g. &quot;Thanks!&quot; or &quot;Well Done&quot;) it's likely it doesn't need to be sent.</p>
