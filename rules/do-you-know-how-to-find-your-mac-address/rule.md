To help with automation you can use the MAC address of your mobile device to match when it joins the company wifi. This allows you to:

* Automatically log when you come in or out (See [Do you know the best way to see if someone is in the office?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=1f63c01f-cad4-4f24-bc3c-9f870112b6fa) ) <br>
* Announce your presence to the rest of the office
* Get statistics and analytics: E.g. Who travels the most? Or which city uses In-And-Out the most? <br>      **TODO: Uly**
