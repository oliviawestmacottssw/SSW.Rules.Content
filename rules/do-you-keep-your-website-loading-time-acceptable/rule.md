Nobody Likes a Slow Website. You should optimize the performance of your websites so it loads as quick as possible. 
You should use     [Pingdom Website Speed Test​​​](http&#58;//tools.pingdom.com/fpt/) to analyze the load speed of your websites and learn how to make them faster.

Then work to k​eep it under 3 MB:


- **Unacceptable** &gt; <br>         **3 MB​​**
- OK **1.5 MB** to <br>         **3 MB** (apple.com is 1.5MB)
- Good &lt; <br>         **1.5 MB​**
- **Excellent** &lt; <br>         **1 MB**
