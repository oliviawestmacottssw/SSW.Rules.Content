<p>Being an Aussie this rule is controversial but we feel that it is worth it for the following reasons. We regularly use web traffic analysis to monitor who is using our web site and most of our users are American. We want our website to cater to the majority of our users. For this reason we use American spelling on our site. Phonetically it makes more sense.</p>
