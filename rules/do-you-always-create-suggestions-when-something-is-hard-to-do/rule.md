<p>One of our goals is to make the job of the developer as easy as possible. If you have to write a lot of code for something that you think you should not have to do, you should make a suggestion and add it to the relevant page.<br></p><p>If you have to add a suggestion, make sure that you put the link to that suggestion into the comments of your code.​​<br></p>
