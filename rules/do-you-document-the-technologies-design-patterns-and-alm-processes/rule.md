<p>The technologies and design patterns form the architecture that is usually the stuff that is hard to change.</p><p>A pattern allows using a few words to a dev and he knows exactly what coding pattern you mean.</p><p>ALM is about refining the work processes.​</p>

If your controller needs to get data, then you inject the component that gets the data</li><li>Patterns&#58; Repository/Unit of Work - repository has standard methods for getting and saving data.&#160;The code calling the repository should not know where the data lives<br> Eg. A User Repository could be saving to Active Directory or CRM and it should not affect any other code<br> You may or may not choose to have an additional abstraction away from entity framework.</li><li>ALM&#58; Scrum - kind of a pattern for your process<br> A eg. Sprint Review every 2 weeks<br> Mostly a senior architect should be added for that 1 day each 2 weeks</li></ol><p>The decisions the team makes regarding these 3 areas, should be documented in _Technologies.docx as per&#160;<a href="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulestobetterArchitectureandCodeReview/Pages/DoYouReviewTheDocumentation.aspx">http&#58;//rules.ssw.com.au/SoftwareDevelopment/RulestobetterArchitectureandCodeReview/Pages/DoYouReviewTheDocumentation.aspx</a>​.​</p> ​
