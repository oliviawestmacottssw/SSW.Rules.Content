<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">The technologies and design patterns form the architecture that is usually the stuff that is hard to change.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">A pattern allows using a few words to a dev and he knows exactly what coding pattern you mean.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">ALM is about refining the work processes.​</p>

      <strong>Technologies&#58; WebAPI</strong></li><li>
      <strong>Patterns&#58; Single responsibly</strong> - if it does more than one thing, then split it.<br> Eg. If it checks the weather and gets data out of the database, then split it.</li><li>
      <strong>Patterns&#58; Inversion of control / dependency injection</strong><br> Eg. If your controller needs to get data, then you inject the component that gets the data.</li><li>
      <strong>Patterns&#58; Repository/Unit of Work</strong> - repository has standard methods for getting and saving data.&#160;The code calling the repository should not know where the data lives.<br> Eg. A User Repository could be saving to Active Directory or CRM and it should not affect any other code<br> You may or may not choose to have an additional abstraction away from entity framework.</li><li>
      <strong>ALM&#58; Scrum</strong> - kind of a pattern for your process.<br>E​g. Sprint Review every 2 weeks.<br> Mostly a senior architect should be added for that 1 day each 2 weeks.</li></ol><p>The decisions the team makes regarding these 3 areas, should be documented in _Technologies.docx as per&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=951ffbf9-4066-42f3-a9b7-e0d8603e728b">https&#58;//rules.ssw.com.au/do-you-review-the-documentation</a>​.​​<br></p>
