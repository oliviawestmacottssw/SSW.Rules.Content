<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">When you’re making a cake the things that matter are the ingredients you use.​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Likewise, when you’re making a video, the things that matter are the cuts you choose.​<span style="color&#58;#444444;">​</span></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​J​ump Cut</h3><p>A jump cut is a straight cut between the same piece of footage (which helps shorten the video).</p><p>For example, if you are doing a piece to camera (single presenter talking to the camera), you can cut out parts in between sentences – and leave it obvious - to quicken the pace of the video. This is a popular editing method used by YouTubers and is great for more casual style of videos.<br></p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify"><iframe width="750" height="422" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/9h73DZuWnEs?start=27" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Jump cut on piece to camera style video. Watch for 20 seconds from 00&#58;27</dd><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Zoom Cut</h3><p>Zoom cut is a useful method of doing something similar to the jump cut, but instead of a jarring cut with the same framing, you 'zoom' into the image in post-production to create the effect of a 2 camera setup.</p><p>This is a great way to hide the cut while also creating visual interest.</p><p>To do this, shoot in a high resolution (e.g. 4k) and edit in a lower resolution (e.g. 1080p). The extra pixels will allow you to increase the scale of the video without losing quality.</p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify"><iframe width="750" height="422" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/Jveq6VFjWTA?start=65" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Good example&#58; zoom cut to emphasize Uly's point. Watch for 10 seconds from 00&#58;65 and you'll one example<br></dd><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">J cut and L cut</h3><p>This is a type of cut where the audio is introduced before the visual element, meaning we linger on the current shot when the audio of the next shot is introduced.</p><p>J cuts can help to create a better sense of flow between conversation and a scene change.</p><p>L cut is the opposite of a J cut where we see the next visual element before the audio.</p><p>L cut can be used to see the reaction of someone who is listening to someone else before we see them talk. This can create more drama and add interest in the scene.</p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify"><iframe width="750" height="422" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/eyH-a964kAs" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; video explanation of J and L cuts&#160;[04&#58;51]​​​<br><br></dd><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify"><iframe width="750" height="422" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/1_g_MZBJHZU?start=185" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Good example&#58; J cut used to transition from Adam and Penny to the guys they were talking about outside.

Ideally a cutaway would have hid this. Watch from 04&#58;37 for 10 seconds</dd><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Fade to black (FtB)</h3><p>Fade to black is a very useful type of transition for scene changes. It is great for the end of a scene where you want to add extra drama or emphasise the scenes conclusion.</p><p>Another use is for opening and closers; in Adobe Premiere Pro you select dip to black as your transition, which will indicate to the audience the content is over, or you can use this for the opening sting.</p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify"><iframe width="750" height="422" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/ek8ArrOfJxA" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Good example&#58; SSW Rules Video Opening sting dips to black.
