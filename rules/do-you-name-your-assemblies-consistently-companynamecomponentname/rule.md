This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<dl class="goodCode">
<dt><pre>System.IO</pre></dt></dl>
<p>contains all the classes that deal with inputs and outputs. As a general rule of thumb your assemblies should be named as follows&#58; </p>
<p>&lt;CompanyName&gt;.&lt;ComponentName&gt; (e.g. SSW.Framework) </p>
<p>This allows a developer to know who developed the assembly and give the developer a general idea of what the assembly can be used for.</p>
