<p>​​Employees on the front lines often have valuable insights into opportunities for improvement,&#160;increased efficiency&#160;or even entirely new business ideas.​​ Empowering these employees with an annual brainstorming day is a great way to transform their good ideas into valuable solutions, as well as giving them the opportunity to learn and grow from each other.&#160;Many employees also enjoy the opportunity to flex their creative muscles in fun ways that their day-to-day jobs may not afford them.<br></p><p>Different companies have different approaches to this. For example&#58;</p><ul><li>Atlassian - give employees 1 day a year to work on a feature they want<br></li><li>Google - employees are allowed to dedicate 20% of their time to 'pet projects'<br></li><li>Microsoft - Scott Guthrie takes senior leadors offsite for 1 week each year<br></li><li>SSW - Adam Cogan&#160;conducts an annual brainstorming day in each state office<br></li></ul><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">How an annual brainstorming day works<br></h3><div>At an annual brainstorming day,&#160;employees are invited to share their ideas, give feedback, and pick the best one to work on. The benefits of brainstorming are 
   <a href="https&#58;//raybourn.com/the-5-benefits-of-brainstorming/">well understood</a>, but in order to focus the productivity on something useful, it is important&#160;to have a system for suggesting, voting, and working on ideas.<br></div><div>
   <br>
</div><div>Ideas from employees can range from business process imporvements, avoiding pain on projects,&#160;or even completely new directions. This gives everyone at the company - not just the developers - an opportunity to participate and make an engaged contribution.<br>
</div><div>​<br></div><div>The process is broken down into 2 key stages&#58; preparation and participation.<br></div><div>

   <span style="color&#58;#cc3300;">Hi All,</span>

       <br><br>I’m starting to really get excited about our brainstorming day! I hope you’re all thinking about what you would like to work on.<br><br>
       To prepare for the Brainstorming session, send Adam and Matt W. something that you would like work on as a group.<br>
       Eg. Our awesome SophieBot project came out of the Melbourne Brainstorming Session last year.

But it can still be intimidating for some people to be the first person to get up and share their idea with the group. To get the ball rolling, you should have some suggestions prepared in advance, preferrably provided by some of your team. Have them record a short video that 'sells' their idea, ready to show the attendees at the start of the session.​​​<br style="text-decoration&#58;line-through;"></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Participation</h3><p>On the day you should follow the agenda set out in your attendee email. The steps for your brainstorming day will be&#58;<br></p><ul><li>Welcome everyone and thank them for their contributions<br></li><li>Start with the retro and kick off by sharing your highlights. Then go around the room and get each attendee to share their top highlight of the year, adding&#160;a card for each to the 'Retro - Highlights' list that you prepared in Trello as you go.<br></li><li>Once you have everyone's highights, share the pre-cooked suggestions you have prepared (hopefully a video or two).<br></li><li>Go around the room asking each attendee to share their suggestion, adding a card for each to the 'Retro - Suggestions' list that you prepared in Trello as you go.<br></li><li>Once everyone's suggestions have been added, invite attendees to vote via Trello for the suggestion they would most like to see implemented at your company. Depending on the size of your team, you may choose to allow each attendee 3 votes.<br></li><li>After the votes are in, you can reveal the top voted suggestions. The attendees then break into smaller groups and&#160;set to work building a prototype or proof of concept.<br></li><li>At 1pm, give the attendees a break for lunch.<br></li><li>At 4pm, all the attendees come back in, and each group takes turns presenting their work to the rest of the attendees.<br></li></ul><div><br><strong>NOTE</strong>&#58; The top voted suggestion may not be technical, and the prototype or proof of concept doesn't have to be a technical solution. It coud very well be a protoype applciation or website, but equally could be a new business process or a video.</div><div><br></div><div></div><dl class="goodImage"><dt>​<img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-use-the-brains-of-your-company/MicrosoftTeams-image.png" alt="office-christmas-party.jpg" style="width&#58;650px;height&#58;500px;" /><br></dt><dd>Good​ Example&#58; A brainstorming session is like&#160;an office party but more productive​</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>
