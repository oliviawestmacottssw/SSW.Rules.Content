<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​​​The brains of your company are a valuable resource.&#160;Employees on the front lines often have valuable insights into opportunities for improvements,&#160;increased efficiency&#160;or even entirely new business ideas.​​<br></p>

<p>​​Empowering these employees with an annual brainstorming day is a great way to transform their good ideas into useful solutions.&#160; Many employees also enjoy the opportunity to be more creative than their day to day job&#160;and have a bit of fun with it.</p><p>In order to focus the productivity on something useful, it is a good idea to have a system for suggesting ideas, voting for ideas, and working on ideas.<br></p><p>Here are a few benefits in doing Brainstorming sessions in your company&#58;<br></p><ul><li>
      <b>Teamwork</b><br>Brainstorming sessions create a team atmosphere. They also don’t happen without people. Inviting your team into a brainstorming session helps solidify that they are all on the same team and opens up the option to ask for help from others to come naturally to everyone.<br></li></ul><ul><li>
      <b>Idea building</b><br>The concept of idea building is sharing thoughts, which triggers new ideas, which will end up in creating a chain of new thoughts and possible solutions to solve a problem. The only way idea building can thrive in a brainstorming session is if no ideas are immediately shut down by the group. This will discourage people from sharing their insights and will limit the success of the session.<br></li></ul><ul><li>
      <b>Outside input</b><br>Inviting others into the conversation to think of new ways of doing either new or old things, allows people less familiar on the issue to speak about ideas they are thinking of. Not every suggestion is going to be great, but if you want to encourage your team to share their thoughts, you should keep open communication to get insights.<br></li></ul><ul><li>
      <b>​Speed up Solutions</b><br>Collaboration speeds progress and processes. A problem may take months to get solved when handled by a single person, but may take just a few hours when several other team members employ their unique expertise to get things done. These perspectives will easily multiply ideas and solutions that a single brain may not be able to come up with.<br></li></ul><ul><li>
      <b>Backlog (or list) generation</b><br>Your idea generation&#160;session should have one person writing ideas down so no thought is lost – you can even ask people to think of it before the meeting and send suggestions beforehand. One of the best parts of leaving a brainstorming session is the list of activities you can action and build upon in the future. Not everything may be applied immediately, but a list of ideas can help you think creatively for months.<br></li></ul><ul><li>
      <b>Breaks routine</b><br>Last, but not least&#58; having a brainstorming session is great to get out of a normal routine. Maybe there are no critical issues to be solved at the moment, but it can still be beneficial as it can reveal improvements you didn’t even know you needed.<br></li></ul><dl class="goodImage"><dt>​<img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-use-the-brains-of-your-company/office-christmas-party.jpg" alt="office-christmas-party.jpg" style="width&#58;750px;height&#58;375px;" /></dt><dd>Good​ Example&#58; A brainstorming session is like&#160;an office party but more productive​</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>
