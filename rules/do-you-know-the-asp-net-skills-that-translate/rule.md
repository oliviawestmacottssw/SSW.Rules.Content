  <span lang="EN-AU" style="font-family&#58;calibri, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;">Microsoft SharePoint Technologies is built on top of ASP.NET technologies.&#160; In particular, MOSS 2007 is based on ASP.NET 2.0, SharePoint 2010 is based on ASP.NET 3.5, SharePoint 2013 is based on ASP.NET 4.​</span>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>
    <span lang="EN-AU" style="font-family&#58;calibri, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;">This means that there are many skills that an ASP.NET developer already has that can be translated to SharePoint directly.</span>
  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Master Pages – SharePoint uses master pages </li>
    <li>Site Map – SharePoint uses the ASP.NET site map provider model and comes with many additional customized site map providers out of the box</li>
    <li>Menu – SharePoint uses ASP.NET menu controls, powered by site maps</li>
    <li>Page Control Lifecycle – the same key fundamental knowledge for ASP.NET is also necessary when making custom SharePoint development</li>
    <li>Web.Config – like ASP.NET – many SharePoint configuration is done in the Web.Config – though SharePoint provides web UI to modify many of these options from Central Administration</li>
    <li>.NET – Your .NET skills are definitely not going to go away</li>
    <li>IIS – Each SharePoint web application is a “Site” in IIS, the site bindings are also identical</li>
</ul>
