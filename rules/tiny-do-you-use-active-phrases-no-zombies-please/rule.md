To get the most out of your communications, your writing should be compelling and direct. The best way to ensure this is to use active voice.

For example:

<!--endintro-->


::: greybox
When the CD is inserted, a Windows dialog will be shown.  
:::

::: bad
Figure: Bad Example - This example is using a passive voice, and does not address the reader or from the point of the subject (the software in this case).  
:::

::: greybox
When you insert a CD, Windows shows a dialog.  
:::

::: good
Figure: Good Example - This example uses the active voice to address the reader, and is more direct and engaging.  
:::




An easy way to tell if you're using the passive voice is to add "by zombies" after verb. If your sentence still make sense, you're using passive voice. 



::: greybox
The email was sent by zombies  
:::




::: bad
Figure: Bad example - This sentence could be more engaging  
:::

::: greybox
Zombies sent the email   
:::


::: good
Figure: Good example - Now that's a more engaging sentence

:::





### 3 reasons you should avoid passive voice:

1. Passive voice uses more words - in the figures above, the "Bad Example" uses 6 words whereas the "Good example" uses only 4
2. It's less logical - instead of having the subject do something to the object, the object does something to the subject
3. It's less clear - In the bad example above, you don't know who was acting until the end of the sentence, whereas in the good example, you know immediately.
