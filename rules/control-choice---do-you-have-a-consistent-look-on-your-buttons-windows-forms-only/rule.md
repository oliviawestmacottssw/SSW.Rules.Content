Question: What is wrong with this Picture?
<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="Inconsistent Button FlatStyles" src="../../assets/InconsistentButtonStyles.jpg"></dt>
<dd>Figure: What is wrong?</dd></dl>   ​
**Answer:** There are three different types of buttons in the Application:

- *Next >* - Default Window Style
- *Preview* - .NET Flat Style
- *Cancel* - Window XP Style

<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="bad divider" src="../../assets/BadDivider.gif"></dt>
<dd>Figure: Even labels need to use FlatStyle.System. Can you spot the wrong label?</dd></dl>
