You should reply like this&#58;<br>
<span class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox">Dear Peter <br>
If it was a quick 5 mins I would do it straight away. However I need to do a little investigation - maybe a couple of hours. <br>
If that is OK then here is a <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Shop/BasketInsert.aspx?ProductID=SUPP2">link to purchase 2 hours</a> and I will spend that time on this and let you know how I go. <br>
