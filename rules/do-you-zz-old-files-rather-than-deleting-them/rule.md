When you are regularly creating new releases of a cool .NET application or simply producing new proposals in Microsoft Word, files will inevitably become outdated. Rather than hit the DELETE key put a 'zz' at the front of the filename. The old versions should not be deleted straight away - it is just an unnecessary risk!

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <img border="0" style="border&#58;0px solid;" alt="Obsolete old files aggressively" src="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/PublishingImages/ObseleteOldFilesAggressively.gif" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" />
<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; 'ZZ' your files rather than deleting them! </span>
<p>Note&#58; Other systems are used that are less aggressive than our 'zz' rule.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In .NET, the keyword <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Obselete.htm" target="_blank">obselete</a>&#160;<img height="11" border="0" width="17" alt="Leave site" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Images/LeaveSite.gif" /> is used to mark types and members of types that should no longer be used - these then turn up as a compiler warning. </li>
    <li>In HTML, the keyword <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Deprecated.htm" target="_blank">deprecated</a>&#160;<img height="11" border="0" width="17" alt="leave site" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Images/LeaveSite.gif" /> is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both allow for some backward compatibility.</p>
