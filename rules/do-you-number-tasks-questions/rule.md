<p>It is good practice to be clear on what you want. One way you can make things clearer is to number tasks or questions. </p>

<div class="greyBox"><p>Hi PeterG<br>Make sure to use Linq to SQL for the bit where you execute Stored Procs. First, double check that executing Stored Procs is still an outstanding issue with EDMX. 
      <br> Don't forget create a .txt file of the same name to the rule, so other developers know why you did this.</p></div> 
<font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad" size="+0">Bad example - the different tasks may be skipped if the reader does not read carefully</font>
