<p>This is quintessential workflow and online forms. Basically you have purchase requests, then business rules, then approvals.<br>
E.g. Less than $1K your direct manager can approve.</p>

<ul> Choices&#58; 
   <li>
      <b>TFS 2012</b> (too hard)<br> You can have requests go in as a work items but there is no workflow service that runs on the server, so the workflow would have to be in a separate web service using WF4.</li><li>
      <b>SharePoint 2013</b> (recommended)<br> SharePoint needs an out of the box solution. You can have requests go into SharePoint lists and then there is a workflow service that runs on the server, using WF3 under the covers.</li><li>
      <b>CRM 2011</b>
      <br> CRM also needs an out of the box solution. You can have requests go into as CRM Entities and there is a workflow service that runs on the server, using WF3 under the covers.</li><li>
      <b>JIRA</b><br> Jira supports workflows and approvals (non .NET)</li></ul>
