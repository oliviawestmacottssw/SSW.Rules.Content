<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Any changes you make to your app risk breaking existing functionality. Having a suite of automated tests that you can run prior to any release reduces the risk of releasing a product with new features that don't work, or that breaks existing features. It also means that you can run these tests as part of your CI/CD pipeline, or with a dedicated testing infrastructure such as Xamarin Test Cloud in Visual Studio App Center, which runs your tests on real devices.​​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​Xamarin comes with a built-in UI testing framework, <a href="https&#58;//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/test-cloud/frameworks/uitest/">Xamarin.UITest​</a>. This allows you to write UI tests that ensure your app's UI behaves as expected. UI tests in Xamarin.Forms follow the Page Object Pattern (POP), see&#58;&#160;<a href="https&#58;//channel9.msdn.com/Events/Xamarin/Xamarin-Developer-Summit-2019/Page-Object-Pattern-and-UITest-Best-Practices">https&#58;//channel9.msdn.com/Events/Xamarin/Xamarin-Developer-Summit-2019/Page-Object-Pattern-and-UITest-Best-Practices</a>​<br></p>
