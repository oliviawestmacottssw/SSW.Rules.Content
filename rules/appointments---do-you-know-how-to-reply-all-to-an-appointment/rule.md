Often your conversation flow with someone will go from a phone call, to emails, to an appointment, and then back to emails.

It's nice to be able to look back and see the whole history in 1 thread, so you will need to be able to Reply All to an appointment to continue the email conversation after the meeting.

Outlook makes this easy:
 ![Calendar window](/SiteAssets/appointments-do-you-remind-attendees-about-tomorrows-appointment/Outlook%201.png)Figure: Open the appointment in your Calendar (You should already have Invited all the required people to attend)![](/SiteAssets/appointments-do-you-remind-attendees-about-tomorrows-appointment/Outlook%202.png)
Figure: Click on "Contact Attendees" | "Reply to All with Email" if you created the appointment, or "Respond" | "Reply All" if you were invited
![Type the messages](/SiteAssets/appointments-do-you-remind-attendees-about-tomorrows-appointment/Outlook%203.png)Figure: Send a friendly reminder!

Reasons you might want to Reply All to an Appointment include:

1. Continuing the conversation after a meeting
2. Reminding someone about an upcoming meeting (especially if you know they have unwieldy calendars)​
3. Getting more information before a meeting
