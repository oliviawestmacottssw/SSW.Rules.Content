Being consistent on your content across the different platforms you use is key to have a consistent online&#160;brand presence. It allows you to grow audience engagement across the&#160;social media platforms you use for your business.<br><div><br></div>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​​​The content of your posts should be consistent&#160;across accounts, which means having the same&#160;caption (text),&#160;URLs, videos, images, and hashtags on each social networking&#160;platform you use.&#160;When making a post that exceeds the character limit of a site such as Twitter, you should write a separate, shorter version of the post to send to that site only.&#160;​<br></p><p>Be aware that if you decide to update or edit the content later, you might not be allowed to do so. Across all platforms, you won't be allowed to change the image or video (if added straight to the platform),&#160;after it's published.&#160;On Twitter, you cannot edit anything. On LinkedIn, you cannot edit&#160;a video thumbnail&#160;too (while you can on Facebook).&#160;</p><p>Across all platforms, you will find that they&#160;have some limitations and recommendations regarding characters. See them on <a href="https&#58;//blog.hootsuite.com/ideal-social-media-post-length/">this blog post from HootSuite</a>.<br></p><p>​Sprout Social has an interesting&#160;<a href="https&#58;//sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-character-counter/">social media character counter</a> that you can test your content before putting your post out.</p><p>Some tips&#58;<br></p><ul><li>Hashtags are really&#160;popular on Instagram and Twitter, but not as much on LinkedIn or Facebook.<br></li><li>Notice that this does not apply to Social Media Ads. If you run campaigns with repetitive ad copy, you will fail in every single campaign. To be able to prove that you have a good ad copywriting on a certain campaign, you will&#160;need a variety of text&#160;to see which ad is performing better and driving more conversions.<br></li><li>LinkedIn is a professional platform, so, for good sense, most people avoid using emojis or sharing memes.
