#### Description

The description should explain *what the error was*, followed by the *why it occurred*. Information that is useful for debugging should be included with errors where possible in a "Details" section. You should also avoid making the text unnecessarily wide. e.g.

<!--endintro-->
<dl class="badImage">&lt;dt&gt;<img alt="Centrix - Invalid Quote" src="../../assets/BadMessageBox.gif">&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: Bad Example - A message box that does not intuitively alert the user</dd></dl>
* This is confusing, because it uses different terminology to the title ("estimate" instead of "quote")
* There is no punctuation
* The word "Error" is meaningless
* Line breaks are not present, so the message box is too wide and the text may wrap in the wrong spot

<dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;<img alt="Centrix - Invalid Quote Details" src="../../assets/GoodMessageBox.gif">&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: Good Example - A message box that is clear, consistent and intuitive</dd></dl>
* Terminology is consistent
* Punctuation is present
* "Details" indicates that this information is useful for debugging
* The text is split across three lines, and the technical information after Details is separated from the description of the error
