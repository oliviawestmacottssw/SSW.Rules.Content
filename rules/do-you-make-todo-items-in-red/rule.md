You might have plenty of ideas when you are preparing your presentation. Add these in your TODO items - utilize them to attract your attention later in case you run out of time.

Note: We suggest you keep them consistent with VS.NET e.g. “TODO: xxx”
<dl>    <dt><img alt="" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/PublishingImages/Todo.jpg"> </dt>
    <dd class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Put your working &quot;TODO&#58;&quot; notes in red</dd></dl>
