Every new project faces the question &quot;What technology should I build this solution in?&quot;. There are pros and cons to choosing new technologies over old ones&#58;
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Pros&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>Productivity improvements (faster and cheaper development)</li>
<li>Less conversion issues later</li>
<li>Happier Developers</li>
<li>Potentially a competitive advantage</li>
<li>Development environments are likely current and so donâ€™t need time to setup</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>All issues are not necessarily known yet and workarounds may need to be found</li>
<li>Backwards compatibility (you may have users who have to use an older platform and new techs may not work for them)</li>
</ul>

<p>One major issue with using old technologies is that you will often be up for additional costs to set up suitable legacy development environments. i.e. SQL 2005 Server, Windows 7 running VS2008 etc. and then there are bills for ongoing charges (if required to host and store dormant VMs)</p>
