​​​If a product owner sends an email to the development team with a request, that email should be turned into an Azure DevOps Work Item before any work is started or the work is prioritized on the backlog.<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<dl><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​If the email's contents or subject do not need changing, then no response email is required. This would create another unnecessary email in the world.<br></p></dl><p>However, if the subject is unclear, send a response as per the rules <a href=/do-you-know-when-you-should-change-a-subject>Do you know when you should change a subject? </a> and <a href=/do-you-realize-the-importance-of-a-good-email-subject>Do you realize the importance of a good email Subject?</a><br></p><p>If the request from the client is too large for one Work Item, then it will need to be turned into multiple Work Items as per the rule  <a href=/spec-do-you-create-tasks-under-4-hours>Do you keep your PBIs smaller than 2 days' effort?</a> In this case, you will need to let the client know this and include URLs to each Work Item.</p><p> 
   <strong>Note:</strong> Once you've moved the email into Azure DevOps as a work item, you should delete the original email from your inbox or move it to an Outlook folder called "Moved to Azure DevOps" to avoid duplication.​
