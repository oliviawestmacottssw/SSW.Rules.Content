<p>Nine times out of ten prospects come to your organization to seek a solution to a problem or need. By doing so, they place a certain amount of trust in you and your judgments. They trust that you can alleviate their problems, address their needs and sometimes suggest an alternative plan of action.<br></p>

<p>â€‹Whenever I come across an <b>Upsizing PRO!</b>&#160;customer&#160;that is still having problems with upsizing to SQL Server, they probably need some help beyond what our program can provide. So I always tell them about how SSW has upsized smoothly for many clients and that we can help them. Though this example may not come across as an up-sell, little suggestions like these could bring you more consulting but it shows that you're on the ball and looking out for your&#160;customers'&#160;needs. Customers normally appreciate this sentiment. You need to remember that prospects don't always know exactly what they want or need and that's exactly why they've gone to the experts - YO.U<br></p>
