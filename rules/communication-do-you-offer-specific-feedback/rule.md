Every day you will probably come across something that could be improved. If you're not making improvements, you're going backwards. But don't make suggestions or criticisms without being specific.

<dl class="bad"> <br><br>::: greybox<br>&quot;Do you know our sales process is pretty bad, what are you going to do about it?&quot;<br>:::<br><br> <br><br>::: bad<br>Figure&#58; Bad Example - Nonspecific criticism <br><br>:::<br><br></dl>
When you find a problem, pinpoint it directly (and recommend a solution):
<dl class="good"> <br><br>::: greybox<br>&quot;The current sales process is pretty bad. It&#160;does not ensure that a prospect is followed up by a phone call within 7 days of an initial meeting. Please create a workflow in CRM, have it tested by the sales manager, and then we will email the sales team to inform them about the improvement.&quot;<br>:::<br><br> <br><br>::: good<br>Figure&#58; Good Example - Offering criticism in this way ensures that something will happen to fix the problem<br><br>:::<br><br> </dl>

::: greybox
"Not done, please try again"

:::



::: bad
Figure: Bad Example - If they don't immediately know what to fix, this might end up in their "too hard" bucket and never get done"

:::



::: greybox
"Not done, you missed the second requirement"
:::



::: good
The specific missed requirement lets them quickly fix the mistake

Of course, there are times that you can 'feel' that a problem exists, but you may not even be sure how are unable to pinpoint it or can't think of a good solution. In this instance you should speak to someone who you think may be able to identify a solution, come to an agreement, and then request that action be taken.

When criticism is generic, it is impossible to know what to fix.
