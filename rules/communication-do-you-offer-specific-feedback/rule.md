<p>Every day you will probably&#160;come across something that could be improved. If you're not making improvements, you're going backwards. But&#160;don't make suggestions or criticisms without being specific. <br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<dl class="bad">
                    <dt>&quot;Do you know our sales process is pretty bad, what are you going to do about it?&quot;</dt>
<dd>Figure&#58;
                        Bad Example - Non specific criticism</dd></dl>
                <p>
                    When you find a problem, pinpoint it directly (and recommend a solution)&#58;
                </p>
                <dl class="good">
                    <dt>&quot;The current sales process is pretty bad. It&#160;does not ensure that a prospect is followed up by a phone
                        call within 7 days of an initial meeting. Please create a workflow in CRM,​ have it tested by the sales manager, and then we will email the sales team to inform them about the improvement.&quot; </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Figure&#58; Good Example - Offering criticism in this way ensures that something will
                        happen to fix the problem.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;Not done, please try again&quot;</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">​​Figure&#58; Bad Example - If they don't immediately know what to fix, this might end up in their &quot;too hard&quot; bucket and never get done&quot;<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;Not done, you missed the second requirement&quot;</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​The specific missed requirement lets them quickly fix the mistake<br></dd><p>
                    Of course there are times that you can 'feel' that a​ problem exists, but you may not even be sure how are unable to pinpoint it, or can't think of a good solution. In this instance you should speak
                    to someone who you think may be able to identify a solution, come to an agreement,
                    and then request that action be taken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When criticism is general, it is impossible to know what to fix.​​</p>
