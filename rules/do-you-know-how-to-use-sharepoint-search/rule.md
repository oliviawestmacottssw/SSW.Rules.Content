​SharePoint search is a powerful tool for discovering information. Here are some tips to make sure you are getting the most from it. There are two things to consider regarding SharePoint search; firstly, how you save information to SharePoint to be more easily discoverable; secondly, how to perform searches within SharePoint.&#160;​<br>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​Here are some tips for performing searches&#58;<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3"> Use Boolean OR and AND operators</h3><p>Similar to Google and Bing, you can use&#160;OR and AND&#160;Boolean operators. E.g. &quot;sharepoint AND search&quot;.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">Note&#58; OR and AND must be capitalized, however case is irrelevant for actual search terms.<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3"> Use an  
   <a href="http&#58;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk"> asterisk (*)</a> wildcard for partial matches</h3><p>This can&#160;be useful if you know that certain words are used together,&#160;e.g. Fire* will return results for FireBootCamp.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">Note&#58;&#160;Because of word stemming&#160;which is enabled by default&#160;in SharePoint 2013, you do not need to&#160;use wildcards to find variations on words. For example, searching for&#160;&quot;computer&quot; will return&#160;results that contain &quot;computers&quot;, so you do not need to search for&#160;&quot;computer*&quot;.&#160;<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3"> Use double quotes to find specific phrases</h3><p>E.g. search for &quot;social media&quot; to make sure you get results for social media, as opposed to results that simply contain the words &quot;social&quot; and &quot;media&quot; in the same document.<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3"> Search a specific property&#160;<br></h3><p>if you are familiar with the structure of the metadata in the content you're searching, y​ou can restrict your searches to a property with the syntax &lt;property&gt;&#58;&lt;search term&gt;. E.g. to search the filename field for the term &quot;report&quot;, you would use &quot;filename&#58;report&quot;.<br></p><div><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Related Rule<br></h3><ul class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><li>
