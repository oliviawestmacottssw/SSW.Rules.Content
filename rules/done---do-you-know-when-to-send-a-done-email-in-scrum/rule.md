Most devs don't send 'Done' emails. Do you really expect Product Owners to always be checking TFS?

 The better approach is:
     - If task/bug came from a client, when it is completed, send the 'Done' email to Product Owner.
     - If the task/bug is your breakdown of a user story (that the developer did to break down a big user story), then only send the ‘Done’ once the entire user story is complete.
**Note**: Send the ‘Done’ email to the [Owner of that User Story](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx).

## Done tips:

- Include the Task #, Summary and link to the item in TWA. 
 - Remember that all your tasks should be under 4 hours
 - Follow the Done Email rules
 - If you completed the task in a different way than previously discussed, mention it. 
 - Make sure that every User Story has an Owner as per the rules.

## If you are working on a task:

When you complete a Task that is part of a User Story you need to send a done email to the [Owner of that Story](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx).

You only need to add the Task #, Summary and link to the item in WIWA. Remember that all your tasks should be [under 4 hours](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/BreakLargeTasks.aspx), do spending lots of time on a Done Email for a Task would be counter productive. Add more information if required, for example you may have completed the task a different way than previously discussed.

Make sure that [every User Story has an Owner](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx) as per the rules.

## If you are the owner of a story:

When the last task/bug of a user story is complete, you then send a [comprehensive done email](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterEmail.aspx#ReplyAndDelete) as per the rules when the story had been completed. Make sure you add a list of all of the Tasks that were completed as part of the story and the Done criteria that you completed.

Here is the [Done Criteria](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DoYouGoBeyondDoneAndFollowADoneCriteria.aspx)we followed:

a. Compiled/Built locally    
     b. &gt;30% Code Coverage 
     c. All unit tests passed

Then add an illustration to show this.

Figure: Good example -  This is proof you have met your '[Done criteria](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DoYouGoBeyondDoneAndFollowADoneCriteria.aspx)'. 
This is all designed to help you Scrum Team members (Product Owner, ScrumMaster and Team) keep a certain quality bar on completion of each chunk of work. Remember that you are not 'DONE' until your team says you are done.
