​​​Most devs don't send 'Done' emails. Do you really expect Product Owners to always be checking TFS?

 The better approach is:
     - If task/bug came from a client, when it is completed, send the 'Done' email to Product Owner.
     - If the task/bug is your breakdown of a PBI (that the developer did to break down a big user story), then only send the ‘Done’ once the entire user story is complete.
**Note**: Send the ‘Done’ email to the [Owner of that PBI](/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx).

### Don​​​e tips:

- Include the Task #, Summary and link to the item in TWA. 
 - Remember that all your tasks should be under 4 hours
 - Follow the Done Email rules
 - If you completed the task in a different way than previously discussed, mention it. 
 - Make sure that every PBI has an Owner as per the rules.

### If you are w​orking on a task:

When you complete a Task that is part of a PBI you need to send a done email to the [Owner of that Story](/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx).

You only need to add the Task #, Summary and link to the item in WIWA. Remember that all your tasks should be [under 4 hours](/Pages/BreakLargeTasks.aspx), do spending lots of time on a [Done Email](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=29d5ca5d-c191-475f-8db2-0086c44ca46c) for a Task would be counter productive. Add more information if required, for example you may have completed the task a different way than previously discussed.

Make sure that [every PBI has an Owner](/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx) as per the rules.

### If you are th​e owner of a PBI:

When the last task/bug of a PBI is complete, you then send a [comprehensive done email](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=29d5ca5d-c191-475f-8db2-0086c44ca46c) as per the rules when the story had been completed. Make sure you add a list of all of the Tasks that were completed as part of the story and the Done criteria that you completed.

Here is the [Done Criteria](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=6449ae79-ba88-447e-aa48-36173029a2af)we followed:

a. Compiled/Built locally    
     b. >30% Code Coverage 
     c. All unit tests passed

Then add an illustration to show this.

Figure: Good​ example -  This is proof you have met your '[Done criteria](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=6449ae79-ba88-447e-aa48-36173029a2af)'. 
This is all designed to help you Scrum Team members (Product Owner, Scrum Master and Team) keep a certain quality bar on completion of each chunk of work. Remember that you are not 'DONE' until your team says you are done.
