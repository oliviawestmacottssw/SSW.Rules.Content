<p>Visual Studio has architecture tools that let you analyse the solution structure. While these can be useful, they're not as good as nDepend at highlighting areas that should be looked at.</p>
<p>nDepend is a great tool for analysing the dependencies between classes and assemblies in your projects.&#160; It can find issues and highlights them in red for easy discovery.</p>
