When you want to update the Rule Title, please DO NOT update them in the list directly.
<br> Click the URL near it, navigate to the Rule Summary page, and edit the Rule Summary Page Title, it will automatically update:

- Rule Summary Page Title
- Site Title
- Item Title in RuleCategoryLookupData List
