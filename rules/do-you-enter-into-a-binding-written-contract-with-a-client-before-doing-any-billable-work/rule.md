<p>
                    Before SSW engages in any billable work the two parties must enter into a binding
                    written contract. This ensures contractual obligations are clear on both sides,
                    mitigating the potential for disagreements down the line and protecting both SSW
                    and the client in the event of a disagreement. Binding contracts can take the form
                    of Terms and Conditions, Release Plans, Emails and Instant Messenger and or even verbal
                    agreements.

<ul>
                    <li><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>
                    <p>
                        A signed copy of <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx">
                            SSW standard Terms and Conditions</a> are mandatory before billable work commences
                        as they explain the terms on which SSW works and the rates which will be billed.
                        Some clients may also have their own set of Terms and Conditions which SSW will
                        consider signing if agreeable to SSW. It is also common for clients to ask SSW to
                        sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) which SSW will always consider.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Long term clients should re-sign the Terms and Conditions every year. Signed Terms
                        and Conditions should be given to SSW Accounts department for record keeping.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Generally speaking, a signed set of Terms and Conditions authorizes SSW to conduct
                        a Specification Review.
                    </p>
</li>
                    <li><strong>Proposals and Release Plans</strong>
                    <p>
                        At the conclusion of a <a href="http&#58;//sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/SpecificationReview.aspx">Specification Review</a> SSW will provide a proposal to the client.&#160;This&#160;will include all the relevant information
                        SSW has discovered during the Specification Review process. The proposal may take
                        the form of a PowerPoint presentation (preferred) or a Word doc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the proposal is not a contract. It does not supersede the Terms and Conditions. In effect, 
                        the proposal is a sales document which describes broadly the scope of the work to be done and SSW's
                        capacity to complete that work. It is not a working document from which the project is managed. 
                        The project will generally be managed using&#160;Scrum, with a backlog in TFS.</p>

                    <li><strong>Ad Hoc Emails, Instant Messenger and Verbal Agreements</strong>
                    <p>
                        Electronic communication such as email and Instant Messenger are extremely useful
                        in getting decisions confirmed quickly but it is important to follow strict standards
                        to ensure any agreements are clear to everyone. SSW does not generally rely upon
                        verbal agreements, always confirming anything agreed verbally in writing. The following
                        are important rules to follow&#58;
                    </p></li>
                    </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/PrepareAndConfirm.aspx">Do you
                    prepare then confirm conversations/decisions?</a></li>
                <li><a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/EmailToMyself.aspx">Do you send
                    yourself emails?</a></li>
                <li><a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterInstantMessenger.aspx#ImportantChatsEmail">
                    Do you confirm important IM chats by email</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Email, Instant Messenger and (confirmed) verbal agreements are utilized extensively
                during a project where newly discovered work, delays, or other work outside the
                initial scope is required.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
