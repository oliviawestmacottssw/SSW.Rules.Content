Just as barcodes allow machines to read data from items in stores, QR codes are a barcode-like vector between online and offline information. QR codes can be easily accessed by any phone in the world that has a camera. They enable everything from online to offline (O2O) marketplaces, which are huge in China.

### #1 Use a QR code to follow a WeChat Business/Brand Account


Customers - WeChat allows users to follow a Business/Brand account upon scanning (use the built-in QR scanner). QR codes aren’t just used online, but also in a store or on business cards to save you typing in a URL.

Businesses - Followers of the WeChat Business/Brand accounts can be sent a limited number of messages per month, usually product info and promotions.
