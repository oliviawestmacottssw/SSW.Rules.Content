This may seem counterintuitive since there is no logical reason to write off the time but in situations where it is necessary&#58;<br>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you are not setting a precedent (“This is a one off” or “We don’t normally do this, but...”) </li>
    <li>Make sure you are not allowing yourself to be bullied (If the client seems entirely unreasonable or just expects a discount, they may need to be trained to our way of working) </li>
    <li>Make sure that the potential for more work substantially outweighs the amount of time written off</li>
    <li>Make sure that you are actually solving the problem, and not just giving a token gesture which may not fix the issue (e.g. just giving a discount as a way of placating a client who is unhappy about our project management methodology etc.) </li>
</ul>
