<p>
                    When you are carrying out reporting (using Reporting
 Services) based on some OLAP cube you should change the &quot;All Caption&quot; 
property of each dimension to be have the value &quot;All&quot;. By default the 
caption for the dimension will be &quot;All &quot; (e.g. All 
Products). This default is distracting when used in reporting solutions 
and doesn't particularly clarify anything anyway.
