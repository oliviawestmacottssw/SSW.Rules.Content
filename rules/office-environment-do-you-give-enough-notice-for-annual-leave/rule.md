<p>
               <strong>For employees&#58;</strong><br>
               Tell your managers and co-workers as soon as you know when you will be away. If you're planning to be away for any substantial amount of time (say 3 days or more), make sure you have told everyone who will need to know about 4 weeks in advance whenever possible. Most importantly, ensure that your clients are not left in a difficult position while you are gone.

                <p>Generally, people who need to know include&#58;</p>
                <ol>  
                  <li>Your managers</li>
                  <li>Your current client</li>
 
                  <li>Your close co-workers</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                <strong>For employers&#58;</strong><br>
                 Give your employees a bit of flexibility for small leave periods (say 1-2 days). As an employer, you should allow these small periods of leave with little to no notice.<br>
                 This will remove the incentive for employees to lie and say they are sick when they need time off with short notice.
                </p>
