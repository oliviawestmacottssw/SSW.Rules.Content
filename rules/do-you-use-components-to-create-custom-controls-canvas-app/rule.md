<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Canvas Apps have many controls out of the box that will work for most scenarios, for example, you would like to create a custom control that combines a text box and two buttons (+ and -) to create a spinner control. You could do this by placing two buttons next to a text box on the form. Problem solved, but what about next time that same control is needed?​​<br><br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>That's where Components come in. Components allow you to create a custom control once then re-use the control repeatedly in your App. It's great for consistency, and any time you edit the component definition those changes will be applied to every instance of the control. <br></p><p>For more information on Components look at the following blog post: <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/components-available-in-preview/">https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/components-available-in-preview/</a> </p><p>Full documentation here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/create-component">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/create-component</a><br></p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="newcomponent-powerapps.png" alt="newcomponent-powerapps.png" /></dt><dd>Figure: Create a new Component​<br></dd></dl>
