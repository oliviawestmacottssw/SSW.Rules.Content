<p>
          The Microsoft CRM customization tools make it no longer necessary for you to hack
          ie. write triggers, stored procedures and .aspx pages. In fact if you were to do
          any of these your CRM is unsupported. Changes will not be preserved in any upgrades
          or fixes and Microsoft will not attend to any of your support calls until you revert
          your CRM back to a supported state.
        </p>
