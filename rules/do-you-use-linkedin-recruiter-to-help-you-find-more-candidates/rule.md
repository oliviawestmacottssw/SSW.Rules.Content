While you can find great candidates in very creative ways,&#160;like through&#160;events or&#160;networking;&#160;sometimes you need a little help reaching out. So how can you get an introduction without paying for a recruiter?<br><br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​The advantage of using a Recruiter to help you find awesome staff, is that they already&#160;have access to an excellent network of great&#160;people.</p><p>LinkedIn is a modern way of meeting&#160;new&#160;likeminded&#160;professionals, but it relies on you knowing someone that they know.&#160;With a normal LinkedIn Profile, you can only contact people that are connected with you, or within 2-3 connections. So while standard LinkedIn is great for people you already know, it makes it hard to head hunt anyone new.</p><p><br>This is where LinkedIn Recruiter is a game changer.
