<h4>Project Managers and stakeholders will love&#58;</h4>
        <ul class="good">
            <li>TFS's integration with code/SQL/SharePoint which provides a dashboard with project reports, giving them greater visibility of the project status and burn down lists</li>
            <li>The easily customization of the data using Excel Web Services</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Developers will love&#58;</h4>
        <ul class="good">
            <li>TFS 2010 for the SQL and SharePoint Server Explorer and the integration of viewing, creating and deploying </li>
            <li>That they don't have to try to interpret a bug report from a tester,  and then they have to reproduce it. Why? Because of Intellitrace, which allows you to double click and open to the exact line of code with the variables set.</li>
            <li>Seamless source control</li>
            <li>No waiting for compiling and tests to run. The integration with the build server (continuous integration) is the biggest productivity boost you can give a developer</li>
            <li>SharePoint Wiki</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Testers will love&#58;</h4>
        <ul class="good">
            <li>The many ways of automating their manual tests via&#58;
                <ul>
                    <li>Web tests</li>
                    <li>Performance tests </li>
                    <li>And the jewel in the crown, Coded UI Tests</li>
                            
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The fact they never have to spend time reproducing a bug before documenting it</li>
            <li>And it gets better, they don't have to document it because testing tools recorded what they did</li>
            <li>Later on, when they decide to go with Lab Manager they will never spend time setting up that special environment (say running windows 95 and IE6)</li>
        </ul>
