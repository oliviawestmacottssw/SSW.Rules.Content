<p>It is really important that your speakers feel empowered, so&#160;make sure you give them the tools they need to run their&#160;event well.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>On the day of your event, chat to the&#160;speaker&#160;and give them the speaker check list so they know how the day will run&#58;<br></p><p>Eg.&#160;Good morning Brendan, here is your check list to ensure today's event goes well.<br></p><p>1. Tell the audience the agenda, so they&#160;know the break times.&#160;<br></p><p>&#160; &#160;&#160;We recommend the following breaks&#58;</p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/PublishingImages/Schedule.jpg" alt="Schedule.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;" /></dl><p><strong>Figure&#58; A&#160;schedule to give to your speakers to help with time keeping&#160;</strong><br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">TIP&#58; Attendees will often ask you what time the break starts or finished, you can <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=b4899be4-831e-466d-a411-4580b4245ee2">use this PDF​</a> to keep them informed, without answering the same question many times!&#160;</p><p>2. Draw yourself a rough diagram of the room, start with intros an​ then go around the room&#160;and write people's names down for future reference. It will make speaking to them later a lot more personal if you can learn their name.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">​​Tip&#58; Draw the table layout before people&#160;arrive -&#160;it's&#160;faster. It's also easy if you draw the view you see looking at the audience.<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/PublishingImages/Diagram-Desk-layout2.jpg" alt="Diagram-Desk-layout2.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;600px;height&#58;450px;" /></dl><p><strong style="background-color&#58;initial;">Figure&#58; An&#160;example of the&#160;room layout with attendee's name, and&#160;memorable things about them</strong><br></p><p></p><p>3. (Optional) Coffee Orders&#58;</p><ul><li>​Ask attendees&#160;what coffee they would like, or ask them to fill out an electronic form and give this to your admin staff</li></ul><p>​5. Please give your evaluation forms out around 4pm to give people time to complete them.<br></p>
