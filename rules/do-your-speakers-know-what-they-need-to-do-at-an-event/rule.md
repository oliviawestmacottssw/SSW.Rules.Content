<p>It is really important that your speakers feel empowered, so&#160;make sure you give them the tools they need to run their&#160;event well.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>On the day of your event, great your speaker&#160;and give them a check list so they know how the day will run&#58;<br></p><p>Eg.&#160;Good morning Brendan, here is your check list to ensure today's event goes well.<br></p><p>1. Tell the audience the agenda, and let them know the break times. You can stick the agenda up somewhere in the room if you would like to.</p><p>2. Draw yourself a rough diagram of the room, and go around the room and write people's names down for future reference. It will make speaking to them later a lot more personal if you can learn their name.</p><p></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/PublishingImages/Diagram-Desk-layout.jpg" alt="Diagram-Desk-layout.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;600px;height&#58;450px;" /><strong>Figure&#58; An&#160;example of a room layout with attendee's name</strong><br></dl><p></p><p>3. Ask them what coffee they would like, or ask them to fill out an electronic form.&#160;​​Tip&#58; If you draw the table layout before the arrive it is easier to locate people.</p><p>4.
