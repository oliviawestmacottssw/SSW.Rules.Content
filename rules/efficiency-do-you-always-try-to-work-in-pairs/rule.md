​​​There are many good reasons why it's better to work in pairs.

I am not a fan of the classical pair programming - which is 2 developers working on the 1 PC. There are times for that especially during brainstorming activities, however on a day-to-day basis, I advise that developers work in pairs, but they each have their own PC.&quot;</em><br><br><b>- Adam Cogan​</b><br>SSW Chief Architect + Microsoft Regional Director<br></p><p>It's also a good idea for non-programmers to work in pairs.

   <strong>Is there an overhead?</strong></p><p>Some projects are done quicker with&#160;two people - especially when they are complex. But on most projects there is an overhead, because of the extra communication between the developers - you now have to please someone else - not just yourself. </p><p>Estimates vary for the overhead, but say it is 20% extra, this&#160;is more than offset by the cleaner code and better solutions that come from two brains working together.</p><p>
   <strong>What if you are working remotely from each other?</strong></p><p>If you are really working closely together, you will be using an application like
