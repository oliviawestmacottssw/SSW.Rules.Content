<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">An outbound script forms the foundation of all sales. It is important before you start calling your prospects to have an outbound script memorized. Whilst you will know your script verbatim you should find an equal need to be flexible throughout the conversation and adapt the call to suit each person you call.​​​​<br><br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">As a&#160;guide,&#160;your outbound script should have at least these things&#58;</p><ul><li>Introduction&#58; introducing yourself, your company and why you are calling</li><li>Questions that immediately identify the decision maker&#58; E.g. Are you a developer? Are you in IT?</li><li>How you propose to offer them a solution to their problems and what tool/product they will be&#160;utilized&#160;to achieve this.</li><li>General questions you could ask them, ie. Did you happen to catch the Wallabies thrashing of Italy over the weekend?</li><li>What contact details you need to collect/confirm</li></ul><p>An important point to remember is that you are speaking with another human and people, in general,&#160;thrive on communication with other people. However, as&#160;humans,&#160;we do not like to be bored by someone just plugging another product. So always approach a call like you're talking with one of your mates. Never repeat the script word for word with no interaction like a parrot!<br></p>
