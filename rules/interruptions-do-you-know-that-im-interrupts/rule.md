<p>When somebody sends you an <b>IM message</b>, they are&#160;interrupting you.&#160;</p><p>When somebody sends you an <b>email</b>, they are not interrupting you. You have made the decision to read your emails, so email is in actual fact far more polite than IM which can be a nuisance.​<br></p><p>IM is only to be used if they would like you to do something NOW.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p><b>Tip&#58;</b> If someone pings&#160;you on IM (Teams / Skype) for non-urgent tasks, call the person out gently and let them know&#58; &quot;Since I don’t need to do this today, maybe an email would be better&quot;.<br></p>
