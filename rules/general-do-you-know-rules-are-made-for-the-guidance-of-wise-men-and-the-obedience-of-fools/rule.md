  <p><strong>Standards should *not*&#160;be followed blindly. Aim for continual improvement.</strong></p>
<div>Of course there are pros and cons to having standards.</div>
<div>The pros&#58;</div>
<ul><li>They help speed up the decision making process â€“ getting you to the best decision faster</li>
<li>They help <a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DoYouUnderstandTheValueOfConsistency.aspx">consistency</a></li></ul>
<div>The cons&#58;</div>
<ul><li>They take time to write in a generic fashion</li>
<li>Technology ones rust easily. Technologies and techniques change often, so you must be on the lookout for the new and better approaches and need continual updating</li>
<li>They have errors as they are written by imperfect people.</li>
<li>People will sometimes follow an inappropriate rule. A set of rules can never predict every path, so&#160; cases can and will appear that the standards fail to cater for.</li></ul>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><strong>So standards should always help the critical thinking process, never replace it</strong></p>

<p>If you think something can be done better or the standard is simply out of date, improve the standard.&#160;Email the&#160;person responsible for&#160;the standard the specific changes you want made <a id="with specific changes e.g. From x To y" href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/Change-from-X-to-Y.aspx" shape="rect">(e.g. change &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y</a>&quot;). </p>
