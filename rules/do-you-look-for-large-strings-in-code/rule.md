<p>Long hard-coded strings in a codebase can be a sign of poor architecture.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>â€‹To make hard-coded strings easier to find, <a href="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterDotNETProjects/Pages/HlightStrings.aspx">consider highlighting them in your IDE</a>.</p>

<span class="ssw-rteStyle-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example - The connection string is hard-coded and isn't easy to see in the IDE.</span>

<span class="ssw-rteStyle-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Better Example - The connection string is still hard-coded, but at least it's very visible to the developers.</span>

<span class="ssw-rteStyle-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - The connection string is now stored in configuration and we don't have a long hard-coded string in the code.</span>
