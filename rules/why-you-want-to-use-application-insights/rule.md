<p>Knowing the holistic health of your application is important once it has been deployed into production. Getting feedback on your Availability, errors, performance,​ and usage is an important part of DevOps.<br>We recommend using Application Insights, as getting it set up and running is quick, simple and relatively painless.</p><p>Application Insights will tell you if your application goes down or runs slowly under load. If there are any uncaught exceptions, you'll be able to drill into the code to pinpoint the problem. You can also find out what your users are doing with the application so that you can tune it to their needs in each development cycle.</p>
