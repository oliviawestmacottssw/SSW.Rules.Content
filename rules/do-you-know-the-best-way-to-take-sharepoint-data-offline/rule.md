This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
We think the best way is to use Workspace instead of Outlook&#58;<br>
<ol>
    <li>
    SharePoint Workspace synchronize an entire site<br>
    a. So when lists are renamed it knows about it.<br>
    b. It also knows about new lists that are added to a SharePoint site

    <li>Outlook can be quite busy when synchronizing to Exchange server; it is good to not burden it with more work.</li>
</ol>
While SharePoint Workspace is quite good, we donâ€™t like to store lists in it&#58;<br>
<ol>
    <li>
    Access has better filtering, sorting options when offline
    </li>
</ol>
