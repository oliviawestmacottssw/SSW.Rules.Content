When you get your task done, you should carefully check each item in the email task and make sure it's qualified.&#160;For&#160;some of the task, you need someone to check it again for you before sending the &quot;DONE&quot;&#160;email.&#160;&#160;<br><br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
Simply ask for that person to come over and check it on your computer or IM him/her if the person is not close by (e.g. in different room).This way you are guaranteed instant feedback and you won't clog up someone else's inbox with unnecessary emails. <br>Reply the &quot;DONE&quot; email like below and cc the person who check the email for you. In this way, you show it was double checked.<br><img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/CheckByEmail.jpg" alt="" /><br><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal" size="+0">Figure&#58; Reply Email with &quot;Check by </font><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal" size="+0"></font><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal" size="+0">XXX&quot;</font>When you&#160;action a&#160;rule or suggestion adding task,&#160;firstly, paste the content into a new Word file&#160;and run the &quot;Grammar&#160;&amp; Spelling Check&quot; to check if there is any error.&#160;After&#160;the&#160;&quot;Grammar &amp; Spelling Check&quot;, you can add it to our website.
