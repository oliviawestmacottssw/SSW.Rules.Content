​Is your price:

- ​$100 per hour + GST (the $100 being the amount exclusive of GST)
- $110 per hour (the $110 being the total amount)

 
We say the first one. When providing quotes to prospects/clients, it is always better to display the net value + 10% GST rather than the total.

The reasons for this are:

- It avoids any confusion as to whether GST is included.
- This net amount is the REAL cost to the customer, as they get the tax back (in Australia).
- The net value is lower and appears more attractive to the client.
- The 10% GST charged to the client is not income for your company. In Australia, we collect this 10% on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office.
- The client will receive back this 10% GST from the Australian Tax Office when they do their quarterly BAS/GST Return.

The total fixed price total is $AUD 66,000 - please find quote attached. Bad Example The total fixed price total is $AUD 60,000 + GST (10%). Please find quote attached. Good Example 
**Note** : SSW and other Australian companies do not charge GST to external clients outside of Australia.
