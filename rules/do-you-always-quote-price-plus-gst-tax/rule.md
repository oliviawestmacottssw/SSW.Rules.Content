<p>​Is your price&#58; </p><ul><li>​$100 per hour + GST (the $100 being the amount exclusive of GST)</li><li>$110 per hour (the $110 being the total amount) </li></ul>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>We say the first one. When providing quotes to prospects/clients, it is always better to display the net value + 10% GST rather than the total. </p>
<p>The reasons for this are&#58; </p>
<ul>
    <li>It avoids any confusion as to whether GST is included. </li>
    <li>This net amount is the REAL cost to the customer, as they get the tax back (in Australia). </li>
    <li>The net value is lower and appears more attractive to the client. </li>
    <li>The 10% GST charged to the client is not income for your company. In Australia, we collect this 10% on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office. </li>
    <li>The client will receive back this 10% GST from the Australian Tax Office when they do their quarterly BAS/GST Return. </li>
</ul>
