<p>Sometimes the person responsible for a task isn't able to complete it right away or anytime soon. In this case, a promise is made and the person either has to make a note in a paper diary, stick a post-it note to his screen, or regularly trawl through 'Sent Items' for all the off-hand promises made. <br></p><p>Another scenario is when the task should be done or will expire after a period of time. For example&#58; &quot;Send Google Analytics data after a month&quot; or &quot;Remove course banner after the course is completed&quot;.<br></p>
