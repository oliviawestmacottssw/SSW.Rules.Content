There are many good reasons why it's better to work in pairs.

For everyone:

* Less time stuck on a problem - you have someone familiar with the project to help you work through the problem
* You can keep each other motivated  and you absorb knowledge from each other
* Experience shows that <br>       **people** are more productive. As per <br>      Strengthening the Case for Pair-Programming


Extra for developers:

* Your code will have less strange workarounds - because if something doesn't add up to a developer, he has someone to ask
* Cleaner code - because you know someone else is going to be looking at your code
* Support - when you need changes down the track, you have two people to call on


*"I have found developers work better in pairs. I am not a fan of the classical pair programming - which is 2 developers working on the 1 PC. There are times for that especially during brainstorming activities, however on a day-to-day basis, I advise that developers work in pairs, but they each have their own PC."*

If you are not sitting next to a person working on the same project, then fix it. If you cannot then at least mention it to your manager.

###  Is there an overhead?

Some projects are done quicker with two people - especially when they are complex. But on most projects there is an overhead, because of the extra communication between the developers - you now have to please someone else - not just yourself.

Estimates vary for the overhead, but say it is 20% extra, this is more than offset by the cleaner code and better solutions that come from two brains working together.

###  What if you are working remotely from each other?

If you are working with someone remote, you will be using an application like     [TeamViewer or another support tool](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=f5be979b-fa7e-4bad-8a47-60fccd308df6)to view one another's desktops so you can help each other out when necessary. You should have     [TeamViewer showing on a 2nd monitor](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=c5320def-3f58-48ef-8ffd-06a64e1d34f6).
