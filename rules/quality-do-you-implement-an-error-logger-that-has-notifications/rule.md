<p>
                    When building an application for a client, you should implement functionality which
                    will notify you personally whenever it throws an exception and log the issue for
                    review.
                </p>

<p>
                    There are a few reasons to do this&#58;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It gives you a sense of ownership of the project</li>
                    <li>It makes finding out what's going wrong easier</li>
                    <li>You can keep a history so you can see if there are any recurring exceptions</li>
                    <li>You can ensure the long term quality of you application</li>
                    <li>You are not just washing your hands and leaving at the end of the release</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You will find that this will lead to more clients who are happy to use you into
                    the future because they know that you care about their application.
                </p>
