<p>It&#160;is important to use consistent language when talking about changes made to a&#160;CRM environment. The terms configuration and customization are sometimes used interchangeably. &#160;Use the following to differentiate them&#58; Configuration, Customization and Extending.</p><p>&#160;</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<strong>Configuration </strong>applies to any changes made to existing options available within the default installation of CRM, examples might include changing&#160;the default currency from USD to AUD or the way emails are sent;&#160;using the Email Router instead of Outlook etc.<br>Configuration applies to objects like&#58; Business Units, Security Roles, Users, Teams, Field Security, Auditing, and Solutions<br><br><strong>Customization</strong> is anything that can be done within CRM without resorting to the SDK or external code. Adding new fields to an existing entity, creating new entities, option sets, reports etc.<br>Customization would apply to&#58; Fields, Entities, Relationships, Forms, Views, and Charts, Workflows, Imports etc.<br><br><strong>Extending</strong> is anything that involves&#160;writing&#160;custom code. This could be a plug-in (SDK)&#160;or&#160;JavaScript code (external code).<br><br>
