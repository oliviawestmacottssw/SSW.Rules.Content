<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">You should design a website to look good when being viewed in the latest version of&#160;Internet&#160;Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome&#160;unless the client specifically requests otherwise.&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">There are a lot of other browsers available, but it is important to consider that most other browsers are&#160;based on IE or Mozilla and Chrome is the most used browser nowadays.&#160;</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​Note that readable is not perfect. There may be some page elements that are less than perfect, but it's just not worth of time to fix small bugs on every single browser.</p><div title="Page 4"><p>You must test your website on these three major browsers, though, because that there will be more differences and problems than you would think. The typical things that you will need to fix are&#58; </p><ul><li>
            Menus&#160;<br></li><li>
          Dynamic HTML&#160;<br></li><li>
           VB Script</li></ul><p>
       You should be able to fix all formatting and layout bugs editing the CSS file. </p><p></p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/browser-usage.jpg" alt="browser-usage.jpg" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Browsers statistics in 2014&#160;– Know​ more in <a href="http&#58;//www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp" target="_blank">W3C Browser Stats​</a></dd></dl></div>
