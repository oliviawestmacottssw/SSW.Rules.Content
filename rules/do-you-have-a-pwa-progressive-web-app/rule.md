<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Progressive Web Apps have transformed mobile web practices to provide a native app like experience&#160;for the users. They work just like native apps and include features such as smoother navigation, offline mode&#160;and push notifications, but are much more economical and do not use&#160;device storage.<br></p><div><div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​Progressive Web Apps ​are reliable, which means they load instantly and the performance isn’t compromised even if the network is shaky.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">The &quot;add to homescreen&quot; option can be used to create an icon on the device screen for easy access and background caching and they offer an immersive full screen capability for enhancing the browsing experience.</p></div><div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">PWAs also account for higher user engagement&#160;and conversions which is probably why many organizations are now adapting this technology to grow their businesses.<span style="color&#58;#444444;">​</span></p></div></div>

      <b>Be installable</b>, using a web app manifest and the&#160;beforeinstallprompt&#160;event to notify the user that&#160;it is&#160;installable.​<br></li></ul><p>Examples of Progressive Web Apps can be seen at&#160;<a href="https&#58;//mofluid.com/blog/10-best-progressive-web-apps/"><b>https&#58;//mofluid.com/blog/10-best-progressive-web-apps</b></a>.​<br></p><dl class="image"><dt>
