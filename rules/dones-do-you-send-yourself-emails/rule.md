<p>​When a colleague or a Client asks you to do a task verbally, or you have discovered there’s a task you need to do but don’t have time to do it then and there,&#160;​what method do you have for remembering to do it?<br></p><p>The best solution is to send yourself an email CC'ing the person that asked you to do the task saying &quot;<a id="AsPerConversationEmail" href="/Pages/DoYouAlwaysSendAnAsPerOurConversationEmail.aspx" target="_blank" shape="rect">As per our conversation</a>..​.&quot; This way both of you know that the job needs to be done. Writing yourself a &quot;Post-It Note&quot; is not the best method. This is really important especially when you are working for clients so there is a record of the requests for work.<br></p>
