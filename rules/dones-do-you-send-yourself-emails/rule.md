When a colleague or a Client asks you to do a task verbally, or you have discovered there’s a task you need to do but don’t have time to do it then and there,&#160;​what method do you have for remembering to do it? The best solution is to send yourself an email CC'ing the person that asked you to do the task saying &quot;<a id="AsPerConversationEmail" href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/DoYouAlwaysSendAnAsPerOurConversationEmail.aspx" target="_blank" shape="rect">As per our conversation</a>...&quot; This way both of you know that the job needs to be done. Writing yourself a &quot;Post-It Note&quot; is not the best method. This is really important especially when you are working for clients so there is a record of the requests for work. 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>Always add &quot;To myself&quot; in the email body so that other people CC'd know what is going on. Don't write it in the email subject as it's confusing to other recipients of the email. Put it in big font as well. </p>
