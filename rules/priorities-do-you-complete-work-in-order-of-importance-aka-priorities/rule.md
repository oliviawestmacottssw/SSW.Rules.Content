With a mountain of emails, it is difficult to make sure the most important tasks get done first. You want to keep your clients happy while still removing roadblocks for others. 

<!--endintro-->
<dl class="image"><br><br>::: greybox<br>The word "Urgent" is more important than the word "Important"<br><br>:::<br><br>&lt;dt&gt; <img alt="Challenges ahead sign" src="challenges-ahead-sign.jpg"> &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Remove roadblocks</dd></dl>
This is the order which you should work:

1. **Urgent emails** - emails with "URGENT" in the subject e.g. URGENT - the website is down
2. Emails about   [Timesheets](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=ffae6faf-35b2-48d6-8999-37a02ad3b9af)or invoicing issues
3. Your calendar - [keep your calendar up-to-date,](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=0786a7f7-bd71-418c-908e-3e12fca21264)so people know where you are
4. **Your existing clients** - e.g. Normal planned client work and client administration (preferably working on a sprint [backlog](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=f0198a96-7a71-4797-b738-d66aa38a98df) and Daily Scrums)
5. **Other client work** - Ask others if you can help with their client work
6. **Prospective clients** - project management, answering questions and setting up meetings
7. Internal - all of the following might have their priorities ordered by the Daily Scrum
    1. Quick Important emails to 0 (emails with an important flag < 1 hour and not something that can go into a release plan)
    2. Incomplete [Sprints](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintPlanning%28WHAT%29Meeting.aspx) (was "[release plans](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/DetailedReleasePlan.aspx)") e.g. Normal planned internal work
    3. Important emails to 0
    4. Help others get their important emails to 0
    5. Get your inbox to 0
    6. Ping others to see if they need help completing their [Sprint](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintPlanning%28WHAT%29Meeting.aspx)

Tip #1: Don't move an important task out of your inbox unless:

:::


* Someone else is going to do it right away; or
* It is going into a Sprint



&lt;/dt&gt;  

::: greybox
Tip #2: Use inbox subfolders to group and prioritize tasks

Also, it's common that priority orders change, but clients don't always mean to, so double check that the client means this.
<dl class="good"><br><br>::: greybox<br>When someone is asking you to do a new task, and you are still working on some other task, you should ask:<br><br>"Are you changing the priority order? Do you want this new task done before the current task I'm working on, which is xxx."<br>:::<br><br><dd>Figure: Confirm with the client "Are you changing the prior order?"</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt; <img src="prioritization.jpg" alt=""> &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Prioritization - The most recent task assigned is not necessarily the most important.
