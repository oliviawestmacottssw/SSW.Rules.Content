<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Topics are a great way to classify your repositories on GitHub. <br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Topics are free text tags that help identify the technologies, purpose, and intent of your project.</p><p>Adding topics&#160;can increase the discoverability of your repos for both bots and human searchers.</p><p><br>​GitHub introduced topics in 2017, and you can use topics to search for repositories. For example, if you are looking for Blazor examples or libraries, you can enter Blazor as a search term, and then refine the search to repositories that have been tagged with the ‘Blazor’ topic.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/github-repositories-topics-search.jpg" alt="github-repositories-topics-search.jpg" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Searching for repositories by topic</dd></dl><p>Topics also help others to find your repository and increase the visibility and discoverability of your work.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/github-repositories-topics-bad.jpg" alt="github-repositories-topics-bad.jpg" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example – no repositories tagged with topics on the first page</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/github-repositories-topics-good.jpg" alt="github-repositories-topics-good.jpg" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Great example – every repository is meticulously tagged with topics</dd></dl>​<br>
