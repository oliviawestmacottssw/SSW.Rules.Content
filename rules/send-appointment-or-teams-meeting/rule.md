<div>​Sending appointments from Teams feels less natural than from Outlook but there are some great benefits:<br>
   <ul><li>Appointment -  You don’t need to remember everyone’s name - The whole team is invited</li><li>Appointment - In the appointment, it auto-generates a link so that everyone goes to the right place to attend</li><li>Visibility - It shows up in Teams Calendar</li><li>Visibility - It appears in the Teams chat (for the channel that was invited)</li><li>Visibility – When the appointment is beginning the app pops up with a button to “Join”</li><li>History - If you decide to record the meeting, the link to the recording shows up in the chat history as well<br></li></ul></div><div><div>
      <br>

      <b>Important:</b> Although the meeting app works great to organize Teamwork such as Scrum meetings or other client meetings, it is not very suitable for more global events such as a retreat or a conference. At SSW we use Microsoft Outlook appointments in those instances.<br></div><div><dl class="badImage"><dt>

         </dt><dd>​​Figure: Bad Example - This appointment was created using Outlook using Zoom - the team members needed to be added to the appointment individually and there are too many options on how to join the meeting.<br></dd></dl></div></div><dl class="goodImage"><dt>

   </dt><dd>​​Figure: Good Example - I know this appointment was created in Microsoft Teams since it was created on behalf of the team (see sender) and at the bottom it has a link so that people can click and join the correct meeting (even without Teams installed)<br></dd></dl>
