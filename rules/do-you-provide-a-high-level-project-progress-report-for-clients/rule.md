Communication is a critical part in project management and it's essential to provide as much information as possible&#160;to your clients so they know the project's progress.<br><br>We provide the following report to clients&#58; 
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ul><li>Project Progress Report&#58; This report helps clients to review the current project progress, check the status of the project and&#160;whether they are over or under estimates. </li></ul>
