Communication is a critical part in project management and it's essential to provide as much information as possible&#160;to your clients so they know the project's progress.<br>
<br>
We provide the following two reports to clients&#58; 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <ul>
    <li>Project Progress Report&#58; This report helps clients to review the current project progress, check the status of the project and&#160;whether they are over or under estimates. </li>
</ul>
