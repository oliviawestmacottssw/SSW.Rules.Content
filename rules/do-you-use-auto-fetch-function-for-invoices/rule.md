Most bills in this modern age of technology are no longer mailed to a physical address and are accessible online. <br><div><br></div><div>The downside of this is that a business may have tens or hundreds of invoices each month and it would not be worth the time for a team or staff member to either login to the supplier portal to obtain the invoice or sift through layers of emails in a dedicated accounts/invoicing email, to then submit it to the accountant or into the accounting system. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Some systems or accounting add-ons would have an auto-fetch function. What this means is that whenever an invoice is generated, certain suppliers have made it possible for the system or add-on to bring in the invoice from the supplier platform to the system or add-on. This is called fetching of invoice.<br></div><div><br></div>

<p>​As auto-fetch is in place, there should no longer be a requirement for any staff member to manually forward regular or periodic invoices to the accountant or to enter into the accounting system. These systems and add-ons can be organised or set-up in a way to automate the majority of the steps ​from fetching the invoice to the payment or reconciliation of these invoices in the accounting system.</p><p>The level of automation can be customised in a way so a staff member can get involved at a certain step to do a manual check, or alternatively, the invoices can be automated from start to completion without any manual work.<br></p><p>At SSW, we use Hubdoc which integrates with our accounting platform (Xero) and has some of the most Australian suppliers connected with the auto-fetch system, compared to its competitors. <br></p><p><img src="2020-11-20_16-59-56.png" alt="2020-11-20_16-59-56.png" style="margin:5px;width:808px;" /> </p><p><strong>Figure: Popular suppliers with auto-fetch capabilities</strong></p><p><b><img src="2020-11-20_17-01-43.png" alt="2020-11-20_17-01-43.png" style="margin:5px;width:808px;" /><br></b></p><p><b>Figure: Confirmed auto-fetch accounts updated every 24 hours</b></p><p><br><br></p>
