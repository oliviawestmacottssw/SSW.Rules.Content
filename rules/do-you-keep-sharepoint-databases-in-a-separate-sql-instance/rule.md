Because SharePoint server will create quite a few databases, it’s easier to manage them in a separate SQL instance rather than mixing it with other system’s databases:

<dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="sharepoint-database-bad.png" alt="sharepoint-database-bad.png"></dt><dd>Bad example - mixed with other systems' database</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="sharepoint-database-good.png" alt="sharepoint-database-good.png"></dt><dd>Good example - SharePoint related databases are in a separate SQL instance from other systems' databases<br></dd></dl>
