This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>If you think the task you have been given is going to take more than 2 hours, stop work, call the client and confirm they'd like you to keep going on that task. Sometimes the client will say keep going; sometimes they will say thanks for checking with them and ask you to work on something else. </p>
<p>If you can, don't wait until two hours is up before checking - check as soon as you realise it is likely to take more than two hours. </p>
