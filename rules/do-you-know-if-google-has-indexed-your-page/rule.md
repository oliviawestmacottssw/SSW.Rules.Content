<p><span style="color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;verdana, sans-serif;font-size&#58;12px;line-height&#58;16.8px;"></span>First things first. Check if your web page has been indexed by Google. Don't be surprised if Google is already one step ahead of you - its Googlebots could have already crawled your site without you knowing. So what's the best way to find out if Google has indexed your web page? Just search for its exactly link.​</p>

<p>​If you can't find it, go to&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url">Google's Search Console</a>&#160;and submit your URL. Note that internal pages should be crawled automatically, so you only need to inform the root of the site.</p>
