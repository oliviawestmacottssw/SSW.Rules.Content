<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​SQL Server rowversions&#160;are binary numbers that indicate the relative sequence in which data modifications took place in a database.​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​All tables should have a rowversion&#160;column to aid concurrency checking. A rowversion&#160;improves update performance because only one column needs to be checked when performing a concurrency check (instead of checking all columns in a table for changes).​<br></p>
