So you can see what functions are being used more often (e.g. reports, menu items).​
   ​Plus, you can work out what fields to show on search pages (standard and advanced tabs) and which parameters are being used. <dl class="image"><dt><img alt="Good Log usage" src="../../assets/GoodLogUsage.png"><br></dt> <dd>Figure: Keep track of what terms are searched most often<br></dd></dl>
You can achieve this with Redgate's [Feature Usage Reporting](http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/smartassembly/).
