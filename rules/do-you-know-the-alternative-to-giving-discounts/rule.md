<p>​​Some clients really want a discount. Most will be happy with a discount for pre-paying. Others&#160;won't go ahead until they feel they have got something more.&#160;</p><p>If a client asks for a further discount, try to&#160;add value by offering something else.&#160;​</p><p>e.g.​</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ul><li>Some of your&#160;products&#160;at no charge​​</li><li></li><li></li><li>A Senior Consultant&#160;for 2 hours a month to complete the following tasks&#58; 
      <ul><li>Code Review</li><li>UI Review</li></ul></li></ul><p>Also bear in mind that offers like 2 for 1 are better than 50% discount because&#58;</p><ul><li>You sell for the price you wanted instead of losing money - adding an extra person or a licence is inexpensive</li><li>You are adding value to what you are selling e.g. more people will turn up to the event</li>
