I've met some people who have more than 5 email accounts. Now I know that it's pretty easy to get a temporary account while you're on holiday in Spain, or an email account one of your clients might choose to give you while you are working on-site.

  <p>We always use Outlook Web Access or VPN when we're out of the office and need to email. If a clients firewall won't let us do this, and we have to use a local account, we always CC our internal account on every email we send. Emails are an important record for your business, and they need to be treated as legally relevant documents. Having multiple accounts will only cause trouble</p>
