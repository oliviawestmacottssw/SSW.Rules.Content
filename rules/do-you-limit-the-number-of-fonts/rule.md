  <p>Each font or style should be used consistently throughout your presentation as it will help your audience garner relation.&#160;While a&#160;different font face or color is a simple way of highlighting certain terms you want for focus, too much of it will do exactly the opposite and distract the audience. The best way is to limit yourself to one item per topic section- the most important point you want people to remember.</p>
<p>Steer clear of excessively bright colors or any flourished type face. Such things are difficult to read and impractical.</p>
