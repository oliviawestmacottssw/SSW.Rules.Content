<p>In conjunction with <a href="/Pages/CheckinRegularly.aspx">regular check-ins</a>, files in source control should never be locked unless absolutely necessary. Use either 'Unchanged - Keep any existing lock' - or 'None - Allow shared checkout'.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Only use 'Check Out - Prevent other users from checking out and checking in' when checking out binary files e.g. Word documents or third party compiled dllâ€™s. (This will be the default this will be the selected option due to the inability for binary files to be merged on check in.)</p>

<p>Do not enforce single check-out at the project level - make sure the 'Enable multiple check-out' option is ticked under Team Project Settings, Source Control. </p>
