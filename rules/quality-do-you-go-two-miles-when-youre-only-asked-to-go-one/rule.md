<p>
                    This idea is different from the above rules in that it strikes at the heart of our
                    everyday behaviour, not just when a crisis is looming. <a href="http&#58;//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%205&#58;41&amp;version=NKJV%3b">Jesus of Nazareth</a>&#160;said&#58;</p>
                    
<div class="greyBox">
<p>&quot;And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.&quot; </p>
</div>
<p>While not everyone chooses
                    to agree with everything He said, it's a valid point when it came to creating
                    a positive team environment. If you're willing to help others above and beyond the
                    call of duty,​ a whole ream of benefits flow&#58;
