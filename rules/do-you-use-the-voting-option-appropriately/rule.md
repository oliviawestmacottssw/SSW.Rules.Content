<p>Usually when an employee from the company wants to make a decision about either a naming convention, a button style, using user-controls or forms, or even something as simple as changing a font; there should always be reassurance from the rest of the team that it should/should not be done.</p>

<span class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea"><img style="border-bottom&#58;1px solid;border-left&#58;1px solid;border-top&#58;1px solid;border-right&#58;1px solid;" border="1" alt="Outlook Voting" src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/OutlookVoting.gif" /> </span><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; using the voting buttons option.</span> 
<p>1. The subject should start with &quot;VOTE&#58; ...&quot;</p>
<p>2. The sender should reply with a summary after either everyone has replied or after a certain period of time to let the group know how significant their input was.</p>
<p>3. The voting options should be short, to the point, and provide a distinct difference for each option.<br>i.e. option1;&quot;option1&quot;;option2;&quot;option2&quot; is not appropriate.</p>
<p>4. There should also be an extra option to allow a flexible result if a member of the email group does not want to vote. i.e. yes; no; un-opinionated.<br>This will provide an accurate result of the vote and will not force anyone to select an option just for the sake of giving a reply.</p>
<p>5. Voters should be allowed to add their extra comments along with their vote when replying to all, regardless of whether or not they think it is their &quot;two cents&quot;, simply because the person who initially voted is looking for any and all opinions to assure the right decision is made.</p>
<p>6. When making a vote, try to make the options clear enough so that voters would not have to spend too much time deciding.<br>A good voting system is one that allows the voters to choose an option quickly and carry on with their work, unless of course it is controversial.</p>
