<p>
                When a prospective client gets a quote for a huge price it's like giving them a slap in the face.
                Break your proposals into a series of <a href="http&#58;//sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/InitialReleasePlanandBallpark.aspx">releases</a> and 
                clients can choose to proceed with a smaller financial committment (such as just getting the mockups 
                done) than if they were committing to the whole project. Often, small financial commitments will 
                lead to bigger ones.

                    This approach also allows you to side-step common delaying tactics of prospective clients by making it easier to 
                    get the project moving.
