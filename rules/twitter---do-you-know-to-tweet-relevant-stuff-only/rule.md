Your tweets should be interesting to your target audience. People aren't going to follow you for long if you make off topic and low value tweets.

Some good examples of things to tweet about:

* 1 day before an event, tweet about the event and what you are talking about
* On the day of the event, check-in on foursquare when you arrive (gives people a nice map)
* When something good happens to you, eg. you beat your boss in an arm wrestle
* Tweet before and after installing new software or after an upgrade eg:

    * Installing #SharePoint for the first time
    * #SharePoint install done - found a great guide to follow here: www.example.com
