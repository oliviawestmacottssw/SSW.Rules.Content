​​​​Do you know the best way to manage NuGet packages with Git? You can get into all sorts of trouble by including your packages in source control.
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>The following are a few issues that are related to having your NuGet packages in source control&#58;</p><ol><li>Over time the packages will grow to be too many and cloning the repository will be slow.</li><li>You could get duplicate NuGet packages in your packages folder as new versions are updated.</li><li>NuGet shows packages to update that have already been updated. This can happen if you have duplicate NuGet packages but they are different versions.</li><li>It becomes harder to &quot;clean&quot; your solution of any unused package folders, as you need to ensure you don't delete any package folders still in use.</li></ol><p>​In order to track your repositories.config and make use of NuGet Package Restore to&#160;​restore missing packages when a build begins, complete the following steps&#58;</p><ol><li>​Read the NuGet offical documentation on http&#58;//docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/package-restore</li><li>Enable NuGet Package Restore for your solution by right clicking on your solution name in the Solution Explorer&amp; and selecting Enable NuGet Package Manage Restore from the drop down menu.
