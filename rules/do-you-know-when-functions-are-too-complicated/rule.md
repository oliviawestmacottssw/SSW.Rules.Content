In general you should always be looking to simplify your code (e.g. heavily nested case statements). As a minimum look for the most complicated method you have and check that it needs simplifying.

In Visual Studio, there is inbuilt support for Cyclomatic Complexity analysis.

1. Go to Developer > Code Metrics > Generate for Solution
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;<img src="CodeMetrics.gif" alt="CodeMetrics.gif">&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Cyclomatic Complexity analysis tool</dd></dl>
2. Look at the largest Cyclomatic Complexity number and refactor.
