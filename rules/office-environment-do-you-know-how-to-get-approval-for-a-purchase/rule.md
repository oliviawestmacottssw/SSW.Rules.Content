​When you need to spend money, don't assume you will get authorization – make sure you have approval before spending the money.
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<span style="line-height&#58;21px;">Let's have a look at the best way to get authorization&#58;</span><br><ol><li>​Send an email to your boss, manager, or financial controller (or whoever the appropriate person is in your company) outlining what you want to purchase and why.&#160;</li><li>The email subject should be &quot;Purchase Please&#160;- Request for xx&quot;​​​</li><li>
      If appropriate, include 2 or 3 quotes, aiming to keep expenses low, and which you think is the best option</li><li>
      End the email with &quot;Please approve&quot;</li><li>Wait for an email back with &quot;Approved&quot; (prior to the purchase, or you may not get reimbursed later)</li><li>
      Forward a copy of the email to the financial controller with&#58;</li></ol><ul><li>
      Your manager's approval (in the history)​</li><li>
      Attach the tax invoice​​​</li><li>
      State how the payment was made (whether you paid it yourself and need reimbursing or if it was on a company credit card, and if so, which one)</li><li>
      If this is for a client, include the Client ID/name</li><li>
      If it is for a client, include if it is to be on-charged (E.g. please invoice (add 20%))</li></ul> ​
