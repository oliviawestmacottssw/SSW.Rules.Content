<p>YouTube is great for exposure, social media sharing and channel creation/maintenance, however sites like Wistia and Vimeo are better for professional purposes because they can offer things like higher video quality, player customization, improved analytics and external links - great for selling a product or service.</p><p><span class="ssw-rteStyle-CodeArea"><em>SharePoint 2013 - What's New?</em></span></p><p><span class="ssw-rteStyle-FigureGood">&#160;Figure&#58; Good Example for YouTube - this would be a video with the goal of getting as many hits as possible.</span></p><p><em class="ssw-rteStyle-CodeArea">SSW Web &amp; MVC Services</em></p><p><em></em><span class="ssw-rteStyle-FigureGood">&#160;Figure&#58; Good Example for Wistia - since the main goal for this would be to embed it on your website and&#160;get clients, you wouldn't be too concerned with hits.
