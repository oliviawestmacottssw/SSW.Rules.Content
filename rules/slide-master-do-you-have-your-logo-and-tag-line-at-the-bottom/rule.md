  <p>The logo and tagline are typically used in marketing and advertising. The general concept is to create a catchphrase that will sum up the tone of a brand and to reinforce the audience's memory of a product.</p>
<p>Neither of these elements are intended to distract, so they are placed in the footer of the slide. It is present, but the influence is subtle and your audience's focus will remain squarely on the content. </p>

    <h2>More Information&#58; Do you know the way to add tag line into master page?</h2>
    <p>Adding the tag line in the master page will duplicate it automatically across all slides. Master Pages dictate the size and font of text that is present on all slides. Unless you are confident with what you are doing; you should only modify the tagline and logo. </p>
