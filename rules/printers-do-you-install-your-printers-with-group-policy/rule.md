<p>This can be achieved via Group Policy. This can be setup easily on a Microsoft Windows 2008 Server R2&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>From Server Manager add the Print Services role</li>

<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Install the Print Services role</span>
<li>When the role has installed, open Print Management from Administrative Tools</li>
<li>Install all your printers by right clicking on Printers and clicking Add Printer</li>

<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Add all of your printers to the server</span>
<li>Right click on Drivers and choose Add Drivers. From here you will be able to install the x86 and x64 drivers for your printers so all workstations in your organization get the printer drives automatically</li>
