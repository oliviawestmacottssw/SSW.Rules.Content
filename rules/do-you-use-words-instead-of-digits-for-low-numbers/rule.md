Whenever writing numbers for a web
audience, it's generally a good idea to use numerals, especially for
complicated numbers. Numerals are more easily noticed when a page is scanned by
a user's eye.<br>For example&#58;
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">â€‹There are seventy three good reasons to do this.</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example - The number is spelled out.</dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">There are 73 good reasons to do this.</p><div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - This is easy to read and more noticeable</dd><br></div><div>The exception is generally very small numbers (one and two) which are normally spelled out.</div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">2 heads are better than 1.</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example - Numerals used</dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">Two heads are better than one</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - Numbers are spelled out</dd>
