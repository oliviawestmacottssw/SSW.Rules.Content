  <p>A great way of motivating your staff is to have some form of recognition in place; happy employees are good employees! One of the simplest ways to achieve this is by having a bell located within the office for employees to ring when they have made a large sale, secured a big deal or some important news to announce. By showing appreciation to your employees you encourage all your staff to perform.</p>

  <p>At SSW whenever a big new project is signed up or we sell an enterprise license for one of our products we send an email to all staff and then ring the bell, which is located in the middle of the office.</p>

<p>Similarly, when we get some feedback we will send around an email, and store the email in a public folder.</p>
