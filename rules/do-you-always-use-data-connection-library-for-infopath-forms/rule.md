  <p>SharePoint allows you to create a Data Connection Library to hold all the connection information that Forms and Excel services can utilize.</p>
<p>You should always use a Data Connection Library.</p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>Data Connection Library provides a central location for defining all the connections to various data sources within your company.</p>
<ul>
    <li>It allows you to change the data source definition in one place, without having to worry about changing the same definition in 50 forms and excel spreadsheets.</li>
    <li>A centralized data connection library also helps your users to locate data easily.</li>
    <li>Your users don't want to know the intricate details on how to get a particular data - they just want the data and have the form working!&#160; So if you as the administrator provides it for them, they will love you, they will use it, and you will have an easier&#160;time managing your SharePoint site!â€‹</li>
</ul>Everyone wins!
