This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
Note&#58; If you are not finished working&#58;<br>
<ul>
    <li>TFS put changes into shelveset </li>
    <li>SVN put changes into sandbox / branches </li>
</ul>
Note&#58; Another way to do this is to enable gated check-in and prevent check-ins that do not have build and tests passed.
