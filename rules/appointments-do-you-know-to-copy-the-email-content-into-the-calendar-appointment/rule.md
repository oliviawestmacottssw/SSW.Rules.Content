​​​One of the great things about email is that as a conversation progresses, you always have the thread history that you can refer to for context.&#160;<div><br><div>Calendar appointments, on the other hand, don’t have this. Therefore, if you make plans via email, and that email conversation includes details like times, agendas, locations, etc., it’s a good idea to <b>copy the email text&#160;into the body of the calendar appointment</b>.&#160;​That way you’ve got the history and context right there, so the attendees don’t have to go searching for it in their inbox.<br><br></div></div>

<p><b>Warning&#58; </b>With calendar appointments, there’s also the risk that people will accept the appointment without reading the content – people don’t do this with email.&#160; So if you are initiating an appointment that has a task in it, where you would like a ‘done’… then duplicate the content of the appointment into an email.<br><br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">-----Original Appointment-----<br>From&#58; Uly Maclaren www.ssw.com.au<br>Sent&#58; Saturday, 1 August 2020 2&#58;43 PM<br>To&#58; Adam Cogan www.ssw.com.au<br>Subject&#58; Meet with the SSW software architects and talk about Code Auditor<br>When&#58; Friday, 31 July 2020 9&#58;30 AM-10&#58;30 AM (UTC+10&#58;00) Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney.<br>Where&#58; SSW Boardroom<br><br>(copy of email - as per rule <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=22e823d0-a5e6-4682-bfab-c44ece74d6c6">https&#58;//rules.ssw.com.au/do-you-know-to-duplicate-email-content-in-a-calendar-appointment</a>)<br>Hi Adam,<br><br>I am the Scrum Master of the upcoming Northwind project and I’d like to understand the specific performance and code quality requirements<br>1.
