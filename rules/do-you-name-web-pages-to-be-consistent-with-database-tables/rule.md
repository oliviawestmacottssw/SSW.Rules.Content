In a database-driven page, it is important that the name of the page is based on the data that the page contains. For example, if a page shows client details and is based on the Client table, then the page should be called Client.aspx.â€‹<div>Other examples are&#58; <br></div>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ul><li>a search page. This page&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/KBSearch.aspx">ssw/Kb/KBSearch.asp</a>&#160;is for searching a table obviously called KB</li><li>a search results page. This page&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/KBResult.aspx?searchOn=Words&amp;searchFor=problem">ssw/KB/KBResult.aspx?searchOn=Words&amp;searchFor=problem</a>&#160;is returning the records for a table called KB</li><li>a detail page.
