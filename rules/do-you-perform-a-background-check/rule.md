<p>
                    If you do not have a system for ranking all the potential clients who come knocking on your door, you will be open to accepting a troublesome client or two and a whole heap of headaches.
                    You could ask if they have any references from other companies, but a less drastic, and less confrontational check is a quick Google search.
                </p>

<ul>
<li>Do they turn up in the results? </li>
<li>Do they have a webpage? </li>
<li>Does the webpage look legitimate (not just thrown together)? </li>
<li>Is the &quot;Contact Us&quot; Address and/or phone number the same as the one they provided? </li>
<li>Do they have any references from other companies? </li>
</ul>
<p>With this information you can then rank them from &quot;Not a Risk&quot; all the way up to &quot;Huge Risk&quot; (the kind with neon flashing lights and all) and decide whether or not to go ahead with the business deal.</p>
