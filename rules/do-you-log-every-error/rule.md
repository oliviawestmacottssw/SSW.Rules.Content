  <p>When you walk into a clothes store to exchange a pair of jeans, you expect to be treated with respect. The sales person should talk to you at your level, deal with your issues, and in a polite and fair way handle your problem. Developers should not expect software users to be treated any differenty.</p>
<p>Every error message you put into your products is an opportunity for good service. Users don't want to see &quot;Run-time error. Can't save record with zero length string&quot;,&#160;instead&#160;the User sould receive&#160;a message that help them through the situation.</p>

<font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Log every error!</font>
<p>Not to say though that there is any ideal error message - a great error is one that has been eliminated! In packaged products every unhandled error is our&#160;problem. </p>
<p>In the old days unhandled errors would be stored in a local Access db, but now all unhandled errors should be automatically emailed to the product team. This is a proactive and polite approach of dealing with unhandled errors. If it's serious we will contact the client to resolve the situation - they get a bit of a surprise and think we have ESP! </p>
<p>Remember what it is like to have good service in a restaurant. A good waiter knows when to interrupt you, when to leave you alone and how to do it all in a courteous and respectful way.</p>
