<p>Not to say though that there is any ideal error message - a great error is one that has been eliminated! In packaged products every unhandled error is our&#160;problem. </p>
<p>In the old days unhandled errors would be stored in a local Access db, but now all unhandled errors should be automatically emailed to the product team. This is a proactive and polite approach of dealing with unhandled errors. If it's serious we will contact the client to resolve the situation - they get a bit of a surprise and think we have ESP! </p>
<p>Remember what it is like to have good service in a restaurant. A good waiter knows when to interrupt you, when to leave you alone and how to do it all in a courteous and respectful way.</p>
