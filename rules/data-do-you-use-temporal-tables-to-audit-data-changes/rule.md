<p>In many cases, there are legal requirements to audit all updates to financial records. In other cases, you will want to be able to track and undo deletes to your database. Some solutions we have seen in the past are&#58;<br></p>

This means that you can devote your development time to areas other than auditing. Also, unlike other utilities which use triggers (such as&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/ApexSQL.htm">ApexSQL Audit</a>), there is no performance overhead because it relies upon log files already created by SQL Server. If required, you can export the log information to SQL Server, so you can perform advanced queries on it. It even allows you to recover previously deleted tables.â€‹<br></p>
