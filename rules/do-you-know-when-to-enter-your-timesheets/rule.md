<p>The easiest way to remember to enter your timesheets is to have a routine. If it works for you to enter your timesheet at the end of each day, that's great, otherwise&#58;</p><ul><li>Every Friday&#58; 
      <ol><li>If you are in the office enter them into your timesheeting system</li><li>If you are working on-site and you have VPN access or web services, enter your times directly into your timesheeting system</li><li>If you don't have VPN access and web services are not working, email your timesheets to your manager</li></ol></li>
   <li>It's good to do this straight after lunch, so as not to interrupt your flow, but, as a deadline, they should be done by 5pm, and&#160;any changes that occur on Friday, Saturday or Sunday, must happen by Sunday night.</li><li>The purpose of this is so that your accounts team can check all timesheets and invoice the clients first thing on Monday morning.</li><li>You may want to have a <a href="/Management/Rules-to-Better-Timesheets/Pages/reward-your-employees-for-doing-their-timesheets.aspx">reward system </a>in place to ensure this always happens</li></ul>
