 The role of the [PBI Owner](/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx) is like a mini project manager. The PBI Owner resolves any road blocks, performs the “[Test Please](/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx)” and makes sure there is a good presentation at the Review Meeting. In addition having a PBI Owner makes it easy for Product Owners and others to talk to the right person. <br> 
There are five things that the story owner is responsible for:

- Manage / Own the story and its sub tasks
- Make sure a “[Test Please](/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx)” is conducted (or that their story is included in one)
- Make every effort to show the story to the Product Owner before the Sprint Review (aka a [corridor conversation](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=70e9f0e5-38ea-4616-bb21-6ba5167beb6b))
- Prepare for the Sprint Review. Make sure h​e ready for the review. Have a scribe, have a demo plan/script and get the story accepted quickly.
- Present the completed Story at the Sprint Review


Note: Make sure you are ready for the review. Have a scribe and how you are demoing worked out before hand.

The objective of the Review meeting is to have the story accepted quickly.
