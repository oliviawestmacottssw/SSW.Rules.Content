The role of the <a href="/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx" shape="rect"><font color="#000080">Story Owner</font></a>&#160;is like a mini project manager.&#160;The Story Owner resolves any road blocks, performs the&#160;“<a href="/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx" shape="rect"><font color="#000080">Test Please</font></a>” and makes sure there is a good presentation at the Review Meeting.&#160;In addition having a Story Owner makes it easy for Product Owners and others to talk to the right person.

  <p>There are five things that the story owner is responsible for&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Manage / Own the story and its sub tasks </li>
    <li>Make sure a “<a href="/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx" shape="rect"><font color="#000080">Test Please</font></a>” is conducted (or that their story is included in one) </li>
    <li>Make every effort to show the story to the Product Owner before the Sprint Review (aka a <a href="/spec-do-you-conduct-a-specification-review-(ask-for-a-coffee-not-a-marriage)">corridor conversation</a>) </li>
    <li>Prepare for the Sprint Review. Make sure he ready for the review. Have a scribe, have a demo plan/script and get the story accepted quickly. </li>
    <li>Present the completed Story at the Sprint Review </li>
</ul>
<p>Note&#58; Make sure you are ready for the review. Have a scribe and how you are demoing worked out before hand. </p>
<p>The objective of the Review meeting is to have the story accepted quickly.<br>
