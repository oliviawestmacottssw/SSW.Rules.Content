The role of the <a shape="rect" href="/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx"><font color="#000080">Story Owner</font></a>&#160;is like a mini project manager. They notify their team members when they are able to start tasks to ensure critical paths between tasks are identified and they conduct a “<a shape="rect" href="/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx"><font color="#000080">Test Please</font></a>” in order to make sure that what is delivered to the Product Owner and is part of&#160;the potentially shippable unit of work delivered by the Sprint.
