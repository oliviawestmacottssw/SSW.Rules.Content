The role of the <a href="/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx" shape="rect"><font color="#000080">PBI Owner</font></a> is like a mini project manager. The PBI Owner resolves any road blocks, performs the “<a href="/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx" shape="rect"><font color="#000080">Test Please</font></a>” and makes sure there is a good presentation at the Review Meeting. In addition having a PBI Owner makes it easy for Product Owners and others to talk to the right person.

  <p>There are five things that the story owner is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Manage / Own the story and its sub tasks </li>
    <li>Make sure a “<a href="/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx" shape="rect"><font color="#000080">Test Please</font></a>” is conducted (or that their story is included in one) </li>
    <li>Make every effort to show the story to the Product Owner before the Sprint Review (aka a <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=70e9f0e5-38ea-4616-bb21-6ba5167beb6b">corridor conversation</a>) </li>
    <li>Prepare for the Sprint Review. Make sure h​e ready for the review. Have a scribe, have a demo plan/script and get the story accepted quickly. </li>
    <li>Present the completed Story at the Sprint Review </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Make sure you are ready for the review. Have a scribe and how you are demoing worked out before hand. </p>
<p>The objective of the Review meeting is to have the story accepted quickly.<br>
