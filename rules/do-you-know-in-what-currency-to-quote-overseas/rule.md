<p class="p1">The easy thing is to just quote the price in your local currency. Go the extra step and convert it to a currency they understand.</p><p class="p1">If you are not sure what currency to use, just use US Dollars, which is the international currency.</p><p> </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Of course, if you are dealing with somebody regularly, then you should know their preferred currency.</p><p>E.g. Chinese company billing someone in Brazil&#58;</p><dl class="bad"><dt>Our price is CNY 1,000</dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - the client will need to convert it</dd></dl><dl class="good"><dt>Our price is CNY 1,000 (about USD $160)</dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example - USD gives a clear understanding of the costsâ€‹</dd></dl>
