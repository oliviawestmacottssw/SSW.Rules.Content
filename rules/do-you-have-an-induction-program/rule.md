<span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">​​​​</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">​The problem is companies have a lot of information – some of it is public, some of it is private.&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">​</span><div><br><p>You need an Induction or a&#160;Continuous Learning tool. We recommend <a href="https&#58;//www.sugarlearning.com/" target="_blank">SugarLearning.com</a>. It's a great tool and &#160;it&#160;can test&#160;employees knowledge for example whether they can find relevant information on the intranet.</p><p><strong>The goal of SugarLearning</strong><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">&#160;</span><strong>is to help you learn.&#160;</strong></p><p>SSW induction covers a combination of public and private information. This information is available on the SSW website (public information) and the intranet (private information). We want to maintain these sites as the sources of truth for that information, so we don't want to duplicate this information on SugarLearning.&#160;</p><p>What SugarLearning does is aggregate your learning items into the one space to make it easy for you to complete your induction. Once you've done your reading, the follow-up quizzes help you confirm what you have learned.</p><p><br></p></div>
