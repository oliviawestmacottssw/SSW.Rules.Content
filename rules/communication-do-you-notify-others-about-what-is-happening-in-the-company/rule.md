When something happens in your company, always send around an email so that the                     whole team is kept in the loop.

<!--endintro-->

Examples of events that you should send an email                     around for:

* An update to a company standard or procedure (including a link to it)
* Births and marriages
* Employees who are starting or finishing
* Anything significant that is happening in your life


You should really feel free to share any good news you have with everyone. It will                     make the office feel more like a family and not just a place to turn up to work.

                    Hi Guys, <br><br>
                    I'm heading to Sanya with my wife and kid this weekend.&#160;I still remember the good time I had there last year at the MVP China Summit; also I think I need to recharge myself a little bit after long time working over 12 hours almost every day. <br><br>
                    Pretty excited right now as this will be the very 1st official trip that I take with my kid.&#160;I hope he likes the beach. <br><br>
                    Be prepared for more photos from my Nikon D80, I think it will be having a hard time during these 5 days.<br><br>
                    Will be back next Thursday, so if you need me for anything, call my mobile by skypein&#58; **** **** (if you are in Sydney), or 139 **** **** (if you are in Beijing) <br>
                    &lt;/dt&gt;
