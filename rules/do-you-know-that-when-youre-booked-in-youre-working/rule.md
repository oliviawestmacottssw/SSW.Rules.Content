<p>When an Account Manager and a client have made an agreement that you will work on a particular project for a day, you need to work on it all day (at least 8 hours), and that should be reflected in your timesheets.</p><p>If you are booked in on the Service Calendar in CRM, you will be billing that full day to the respective client.</p>
