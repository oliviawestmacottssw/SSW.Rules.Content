When your team has completed a release successfully, they should be rewarded with a morale boosting event such as lunch, dinner, the movies or bowling, so long as you can meet the following conditions&#58; 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <ol>
    <li>Budget - the release must be completed within the budget allocated </li>
    <li>Scope - no more than 50%&#160;reduction in work item hours </li>
    <li>Quality - must pass test please and get a mark of 7/10 or above from the client </li>
    <li>Time - the release cannot be delivered 50% over time e.g. if the planned finish date was 14 days (two weeks) after the start, then the release must be delivered less than 21 days after the start date </li>
    <li>Release debrief - sent to the client and completed and a review of &quot;Rules to better project management&quot; by the project manager</li>
</ol>
