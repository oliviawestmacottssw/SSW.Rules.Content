How do you want customers to send you feedback? Phone calls? Emails? A website? 
There are a number of web applications that do a great job on this:

* [UserVoice](https://www.uservoice.com/)
* [GetSatisfication](https://getsatisfaction.com/corp/)
* [UserEcho](https://userecho.com/)

[UserVoice](https://www.uservoice.com/) is the most popular platform to collect, manage, and prioritize user feedback. It has a voting and tickets system out of the box.

Many software houses use this for their products Eg. SSW Code Auditor, SSW Link Auditor
