<div>Using dynamic dependencies by loading them at runtime can be useful, but it's not always required and does have some disadvantages.&#160; You shouldn't always look to MEF to implement a dynamic strategy.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​If a reference doesn't need to be dynamically loaded at runtime, it's perfectly fine to have a default constructor that has a hardcoded instantiation of a dependency. If it was never a requirement to make that thing configurable or dynamic, don't invent business requirements just because using an IoC container is &quot;fancier&quot;.</p>
<p>There are disadvantages to using dynamic loading of references&#58; </p>
<ol><li>You lose your Code Analysis. Only static references can be analysed by code analysis tools.</li>
<li>You lose your traceability. Visual Studio can no longer show you what concrete method is being called at design time.</li></ol>
<p class="ssw-rteStyle-Strike">c. Suggestion to MS&#58; Currently if you use reflection, meth, unity etc… they don’t show in the dependency graph. Microsoft should support this.</p>
<p>For some examples of when you shouldn't use dynamic dependencies, look at these articles&#58; <a href="http&#58;//www.devtrends.co.uk/blog/how-not-to-do-dependency-injection-the-static-or-singleton-container">How Not to do Dependency Injection</a> and <a href="http&#58;//stackoverflow.com/questions/871405/why-do-i-need-an-ioc-container-as-opposed-to-straightforward-di-code">Why do I need an IoC Container?</a>.</p>
