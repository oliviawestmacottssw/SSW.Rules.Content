When you present visitors to your site with an opportunity to sign in, you should                     always include an option to have that person signed in automatically.

<!--endintro-->
<dl class="goodImage">   <dt> 
      <img src="signin.jpg" alt="Sign In Automatically">
   </dt><dd> Figure: 'Stay signed in' checkbox is available</dd></dl>
This should be implemented simply by using a checkbox. A cookie should be stored on the user's computer so that next time they visit your site the sign in process is automatic.
