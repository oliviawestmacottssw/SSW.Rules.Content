<p>So if you want to compare 2 databases&#160;SQL Compare (or Data Dudes Compare)&#160;is great tools. They even let you synchronize sweetly between these 2 databases. However, if you are doing this at the end of your release cycle, you have a problem.&#160;&#160;Your schema deployment process is broken.</p>
<p>What you should be doing is seeing your <a shape="rect" href="/Standards/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSQLServerSchemaDeployment/Pages/DoYouHaveASchemaMaster.aspx" title="Database Schema Master">Schema Master</a> each time you have a new .sql file. You do this during the development process, not at the end in the package and deployment process. </p>
