SQL Compare is a good tool to find out the differences between two databases. It can help you answer the question "Is your database the same as mine?". <br>
<br>
Let's see what it is good at. 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <dl class="image">
    <dt><img alt="" src="SQLCompareSync.png" /> </dt>
    <dd>Figure: You can use SQL Compare to make two databases the same </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="image">
    <dt><img alt="" src="SQLCompareTables.png" /> </dt>
    <dd>Figure: SQL Compare clearly shows some tables are missing </dd>
</dl>
<p>So if you want to compare 2 databases SQL Compare (or Data Dudes Compare) is great tools. They even let you synchronize sweetly between these 2 databases. However, if you are doing this at the end of your release cycle, you have a problem.  Your schema deployment process is broken.</p>
<p>What you should be doing is seeing your <a shape="rect" href="/Pages/DoYouHaveASchemaMaster.aspx" title="Database Schema Master">Schema Master</a> each time you have a new .sql file. You do this during the development process, not at the end in the package and deployment process. </p>
<dl class="image">
    <dt><img alt="" src="SQLScriptInTFS.png" /> </dt>
    <dd>Figure: Give your SQL scripts to 'Schema Master' who will, check them into TFS, then run them </dd>
</dl>
<font class="ms-rteCustom-YellowBorderBox" size="+0">Note: We have a tool called <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/SQLDeploy/">SQL Deploy</a> to help with automatic deployment.</font>
