  <p>Every week&#160;the project manager should meet with the client to conduct an external &quot;Test Please&quot; as well as to discuss the status of the release. </p>
<p>Tip #1&#58; Choose the same day each week (for example SSW chooses Tuesday)<br>
Tip #2&#58; While it is better to conduct an internal &quot;Test Please&quot; before the meeting (for example SSW chooses Friday), this &quot;Release Update/Debrief Meeting&quot; should proceed (even if it hasn't been completed).</p>
<p>This is the agenda&#58;</p>

    <li>Status of original work items - are they all done? </li>
    <li>External <a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/InternalTestPlease.aspx">Test Please</a> - go through the application and get the clients thoughts. Many&#160;issues they&#160;see, will already be reported by the internal &quot;Test Please&quot;. Send emails for the new ones. </li>
    <li>Triage these additional work items - try to move all to the next release </li>
    <li>Approval for additional work items/budget overruns&#160;- talk $$ <br>
    eg. look at the &quot;Actual&quot; and &quot;Estimate&quot; figures on the top of the report </li>
    <li>Release sign-off - &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;? </li>
