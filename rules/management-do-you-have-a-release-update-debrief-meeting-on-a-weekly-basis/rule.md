<p>Every week the project manager should meet with the client to conduct an external &quot;Test Please&quot; as well as to discuss the status of the release. While it is better to conduct an internal &quot;test please&quot; before the meeting, the update/debrief should proceed even if it hasn't been completed.</p>
<p>This is the agenda&#58;</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ol>
<li><a title="" href="/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/InternalTestPlease.aspx">Test please</a> 
<li>Status of original work items 
<li>Triage additional work items 
<li>Approval for additional work items/budget overruns 
<li>Release sign-off &amp; deployment schedule 
<li>Approval of next release 
<li>Ask the client for a mark out of 10 for the release</li></ol>
<p>You can use the <a title="" href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/EXtremeEmails/ManageProjects.aspx#ReleaseDebrief">eXtreme Emails Release update/debrief</a> template or SSW's TFS add-in **Link needed** to easily confirm the outcome of the meeting by email.</p>
<p><strong>Promote your success</strong></p>
<p>If the debrief&#160;is the last one of the project always&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a case study and get it approved - make sure it's branded nicely for the client</li>
<li>Ask for&#160;a testimonial for the work you have done</li>
<li>Add&#160;a link to the work you have done from your website or marketing material</li></ul>
