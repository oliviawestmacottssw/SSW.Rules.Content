The better you describe the problem you had, the more effective will be the solution. 
<!--endintro-->

Make sure you always explain and give as much details as you can of how you got an error or a bad experience.

Better than a good description of the bug is a screen recording. This should be followed for a more detailed report. Use [Snagit](http&#58;//www.techsmith.com/snagit.html) (preferred) or [Jing](http&#58;//www.techsmith.com/jing.html) to record your screen.
