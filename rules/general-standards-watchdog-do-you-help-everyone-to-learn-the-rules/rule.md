<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">&quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&quot; goes the saying. Having a strict coding standard is prevention. To create good code you must have good standards, such as commenting standards, naming standards, versioning standards and more.&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><b>But this can really only happen if you’re going to <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=36598961-2933-4a95-ba4b-9ed702e405ef">go the extra mile</a>&#160;and stick your neck out and correct someone. </b><br></p>

Standards are important because they ensure your experience at work is consistent and enjoyable.

Remember, it can be just as important for someone’s professional development to give feedback as it is to receive it. Being able to communicate feedback in an&#160;effective and professional manner can benefit you in any career.&#160;​<br><br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">
   <b>To&#58;</b> Peter<br><b>CC&#58;</b> Adam (Manager)<br>​<br>Dear Peter,<br><br>While you were away, I came across a page called ApplicationForm.aspx which was giving an error&#58;&#160;<br>'The conversion of a char data type to a&#160;DateTime&#160;data type resulted in an out-of-range&#160;DateTime&#160;value.'&#160;<br>This happened when I entered '13/06/2018' into&#160;the&#160;'Start Date' field of the form.<br>The error occurs because you are not using the default language of the server which is 'English' - for the users of this database FRDC. This is the same as US English format of Months first, then Days, then a four-digit Year (mm/dd/yyyy). Instead, you used 'British English' on the FRDC database which has a format of dd/mm/yyyy. Please use the standard as per&#160;Rules to Better SQLServer Databases, Rule 1200 (Middle Tier Section)<br><br>Please note that whilst inserting data from your Front End application, you should not use the format dd/mm/yyyy.&#160;Instead,&#160;you should use&#160;yyyy/mm/dd<br><br>Let's fix it together when we get to work tomorrow.<br><br>Cheers, DDK<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood"> Figure&#58; Good example - nicely informing of a standards violation <br></dd>
