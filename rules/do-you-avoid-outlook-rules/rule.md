<p>Some people make extensive use of the rules wizard so that as email messages arrive they already appear in the appropriately created folder. I basically think this doesn't work as you never look at these emails.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>I guess there could be special folders for bug reports that are sent by exception handlers, but I still would not be keen on this.</p>
<p>A better way is Conversation View and collapsing them if you need to hide them.&#160;</p><span class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea"><img style="border-bottom&#58;0px solid;border-left&#58;0px solid;border-top&#58;0px solid;border-right&#58;0px solid;" border="0" alt="Conversation View" src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/conversationview.JPG" /> </span><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Conversation View allows you to choose which folders to collapse.</span>
