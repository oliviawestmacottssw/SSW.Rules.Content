  <p>Some people make extensive use of the rules wizard so that as email messages arrive they already appear in the appropriately created folder. I basically think this doesn't work as you never look at these emails.

  <p>I guess there could be special folders for bug reports that are sent by exception handlers, but I still would not be keen on this.</p>
<p>A better way is Conversation View and collapsing them if you need to hide them. </p>
