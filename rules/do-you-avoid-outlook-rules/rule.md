This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).

<p>I guess there could be special folders for bug reports that are sent by exception handlers, but I still would not be keen on this.</p>

<dl class="image">
<dt><img style="border-right&#58;0px solid;border-top&#58;0px solid;border-left&#58;0px solid;border-bottom&#58;0px solid;" alt="Conversation View" src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/conversationview.JPG" border="0" />
