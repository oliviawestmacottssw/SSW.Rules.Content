You can find it at \\server\Reports_Adhoc\SalesByRegion.xlsx<br><br>I suggest adding this into our Performance Point Cube so I could find it at a URL.  <br><br>Jonny<br></p></div><div><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure - Bad Example: If you can't build it yourself, send an email to your boss for a number<br></dd></dl><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"> <img src="Power BI.png" alt="Power BI.png" style="margin:5px;width:808px;" /> <dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood"> Figure - Good Example: Sate your own curiosity with Power BI</dd> </dl>​See Ulysses' video on how Power BI is the best tool for this: <a href="https://tv.ssw.com/6839/power-bi-finally-can-make-decisions-based-facts-ulysses-maclaren">https://tv.ssw.com/6839/power-bi-finally-can-make-decisions-based-facts-ulysses-maclaren</a>​<br>​<br></div>
