It is difficult for users to find their required records in a huge amount of data, so adding the filter data functionalities is very useful.    
<!--endintro-->

The standard DataGrid of ASP.NET doesn't include this functionality, developers need to implement it by themselves.
<dl class="badImage">    <dt><img alt="Bad Example - implement data filter manually" src="FilterDataInDataGrid.jpg"> </dt>
    <dd>Figure: Bad Example - implement data filter manually</dd></dl>
Fortunately, RadGrid supplies this perfect feature.
<dl class="goodImage">    <dt><img alt="Good Example - add an attribute to filter data" src="FilterDataInRadGrid.jpg"> </dt>
    <dd>Figure: Good Example - add an attribute to filter data</dd></dl>
Developer can turn this feature on by setting the AllowFilteringByColumn="True".
