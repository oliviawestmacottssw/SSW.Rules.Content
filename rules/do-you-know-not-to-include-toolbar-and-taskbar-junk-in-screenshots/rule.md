Screenshots are a very important part of websites these days. Be careful to avoid unnecessary toolbars and taskbars in screen shots.

<dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="Bad_Screenshot-with-personal-data.JPG" alt="bad example as the taskbar and the Googletoolbar have been captured"></dt><dd>Figure: Bad Example - This screenshot includes personal browsers</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="Good_No-Personal-Info.jpg" alt="Good example  the taskbar and Googletoolbar have been hidden before capturing the screenshot"></dt><dd>Figure: Good Example - This screenshot has been cropped to hide personal browsers</dd></dl>
Tips:

1. Use a region screen shot if appropriate (however the URL is generally helpful in most browser screen shots)
2. Go full screen e.g. F11 in Internet Explorer, then <alt>+<print></print></alt>
3. Always have the 'Auto-hide the taskbar' option checked
