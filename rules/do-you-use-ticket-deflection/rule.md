Providing your clients a personal service is really important, but it's expensive.&#160;Great deflected tickets give a more consistent experience and quicker experience, plus they are cheaper compared with support personnel.&#160;<br>

<p>
   <strong>Step 1&#58;</strong>&#160;You&#160;should&#160;find the most common requests and make sure they can&#160;be deflected&#160;by creating FAQs or blog posts.</p><p>This way&#160;you&#160;help your&#160;users&#160;to&#160;access the information they need and help themselves before submitting a ticket, avoiding the contact with your support team.</p><p>
   <strong>Step 2&#58;</strong>&#160;Use a ticket system that supports deflected tickets. Zendesk is the leading solution with deflected tickets. ServiceNow is another good one.&#160;
