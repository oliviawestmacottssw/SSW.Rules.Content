It’s important to have clear options for how a client can engage your services. You need to be clear on any differences between them in both billing and project management.
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>SSW offers both fixed price and time and materials contracts although all specification work is done on a time and materials basis.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Time &amp; Materials&#58;</strong> We work to your specification, billing for the number of hours we accrue. The benefit of this type of development is flexibility – you are able to add, remove and reprioritise development tasks during development. </li>
<li><strong>Prepaid Time &amp; Materials&#58;</strong> Time and Materials clients have the option of a prepaid discount – buying blocks of 40 hours per resource in advance entitles you to a $15 per hour discount on the hourly rate of each developer. You should see the specific terms on our Terms &amp; Conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Price&#58;</strong> Fixed price contracts necessitate having a specification signed off before work commences. This spec can't be altered, so additional items must wait until the fixed price contract is completed. The benefit of this type of development is that your expenditure is fixed. Fixed price projects are charged at a 20% premium to the project cost based on the standard hourly rates.</li></ul>
