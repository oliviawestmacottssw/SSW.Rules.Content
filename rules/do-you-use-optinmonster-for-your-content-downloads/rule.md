Content marketing is a great way to increase interest in your business and helps to improve lead generation.<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​The best way to achieve this is to use gated content, which requires potential leads to provide their details in order to access the content offered. There are a number of platforms which allow you to create these forms and embed them onto your site.<br>&#160;<br>At SSW we did some research, and after initially using LeadPages, we decided to swap to OptinMonster. This choice was made for a few reasons, OptinMonster is significantly cheaper than LeadPages, and provides all the features we required including; form builders, pop-up forms, mobile friendly, A/B testing and tracking. &#160;<br></p><p><img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-use-optinmonster-for-your-content-downloads/Picture1.png" alt="Picture1.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" />&#160;</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Example of OptinMonster pop-up form on <a href="https&#58;//tv.ssw.com/">SSWTV​</a><br></dd><p>​​<br></p>
