<p>Your software is deployed. How do you tell users months or years later, important information? <br></p><p>This primarily affects Windows clients but even web clients shouldn't need a new version to give a new message. <br></p><p>Most software is deployed without any mechanism to insert a message in older software.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​​Messages might range from helpful tips that are undiscovered that would help a user do their job better?<br>Or helpful to remind old customers to get off their old version. <br>Eg. Sometimes customers are just not aware that their TFS or CRM installation is years old? ​<br></p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
