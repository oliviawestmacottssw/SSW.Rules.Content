When the Product Owner verbally requests a change to a PBI, how do you update the PBI to reflect the change and also keep track of the conversation?

<!--endintro-->

You could send yourself a "[To Myself](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=5c16d531-007d-49ef-8acc-b26596e13e84)" email and update the PBI description accordingly, but only those people included in the email chain are aware of the conversation.

   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Bad Example – don't use emails to update tasks</dd></dl>
Instead, what you should do is use the discussions feature in the PBI and mention the user using "@<username>". <br>The benefits of using comments are:<br> </username>

* Quick and easy, no need to compose an email
* History is visible to anyone looking at the PBI (with email, if you don’t cc them, they wouldn’t have a clue)
* Easy to see all important notes/comments in one place instead of digging through email





When someone (especially the PO) asks you to fix a PBI, mention that person in the PBI comments so he knows when it’s fixed.

Example: When replying to "Hey XXX, can you please fix PBI 123?"



::: bad
Bad example: "I have found the PBI and moved it near the top of our backlog"

::: good
Good example: "I have found the PBI, prioritized it near the top, and @mentioned you so you know when it is fixed"

 **Tip:** You can @mention on your pull requests as well.
