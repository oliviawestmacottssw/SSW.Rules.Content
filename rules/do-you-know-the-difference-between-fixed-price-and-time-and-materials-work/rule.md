There are two fundamental ways any consultant can bill clients&#58;

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>
    <b>Time and Materials</b> </p>
<p>Time and materials is the standard mode of operation where the client is billed for the time spent by the consultant. There is no warranty on time and materials work. </p>
<p><b>Fixed Price</b> </p>
<p>Fixed price is where the client is billed a fixed amount agreed between the client and the consultant. Fixed price contracts have the following conditions&#58; </p>
<ul>
    <li>All specification work to be conducted on a Time and Materials basis </li>
    <li>All screen mock-ups and business rules must be signed by the client </li>
    <li>A fixed price can only be done on a release by release basis, not on an entire project (this protects everyone) </li>
    <li>A 20% premium is added to the release estimates - just like an insurance premium because the consultant is carrying the risk </li>
    <li>Variations/change requests through the development and testing of the release are moved to the next release (otherwise dependencies are too affected) </li>
    <li>Development is conducted off-site (to prevent unauthorised scope-development) </li>
    <li>50% of the fixed price is payable before work commences, the balance is payable at the delivery of the first external test please </li>
    <li>There is a 30 day warranty on <a href="/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/BugDefinition.aspx">bugs</a> which commences when the first external test please is issued </li>
    <li>The following release cannot commence until the prior release is signed-off.</li>
</ul>
