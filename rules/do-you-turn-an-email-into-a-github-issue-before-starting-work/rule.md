If a Product Owner sends an email to the development team with a request, that email should be turned into a Github Issue before any work is started or the work is prioritized on the backlog. 



Power Automate has a connector to do this automatically when an email arrives in Outlook. It can create a new Github Issue by parsing the From, To, Subject and body of the email. 




However, at the moment there is a limitation that it doesn't read inline attachments in emails and therefore you have to create your issues manually in Github.
