​​If a product owner sends an email to the development team with a request, that email should be turned into a Github Issue before any work is started or the work is prioritized on the backlog. Although Power Automate has a connector to do this automatically when an email arrives in Outlook, at the moment it doesn't work when the email has&#160;inline attachments.<br>
