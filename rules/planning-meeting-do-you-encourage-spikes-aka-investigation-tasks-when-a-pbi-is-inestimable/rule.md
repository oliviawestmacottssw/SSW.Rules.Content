Sometimes it can be unclear to The Scrum Team whether a Story can be completed as required.&#160; 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>For example the story “automatically package with Wise after the automatic build” requires investigation to see if this is possible.&#160; It is then best to write a new story “Investigate whether it is possible to automatically build with Wise”.&#160; This story can be more accurately estimated and the result will allow the original story to be estimated or revised. </p>

<b class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad example – I want you to implement something, but I am not going to tell you want it is. How long will it take?</b></p>
<p>To embark on the original story when it was inestimable would be irresponsible and leave The Team with a potentially impossible story and the risk of a failed sprint.</p>
<p>All Spikes are experiments or investigations of just enough detail to determine an estimate for the related story.&#160; All investigating storys must be timeboxed as otherwise the process of investigation can meander and never come to a conclusion. </p>

<b class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good example – The time boxed investigation comes first as it is impossible to estimate implementing something you do not know</b></p>
<p>Note&#58; This gives you work for future Sprint<br>
Note&#58; this is also known as a Spike or Prototype, we call it investigating story</p>
