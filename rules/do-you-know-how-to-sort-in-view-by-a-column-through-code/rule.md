You may know that it is quite easy to sort view by a column through the UI.<dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="SortInView.png" alt="SortInView.png" style="margin:5px;width:650px;"></dl> **Figure: Change view column sort from web UI** 
But when you are trying to do that via code, you may find a pretty tricky issue.

<!--endintro-->
 You can use some code like:

view.Query = "<orderby><fieldref name="\&quot;Modified\&quot;" ascending="\&quot;"></fieldref><strong>FALSE</strong> \" /></orderby>";
 **Figure: Use code to change view sort** 
but the below code won't work:



view.Query = "<orderby><fieldref name="\&quot;Modified\&quot;" ascending="\&quot;"></fieldref><strong>False</strong> \" /></orderby>";


::: bad
Bad Example - the Ascending attribute is case-sensitive

The full code should be some code like:


SPView view = list.DefaultView;
view.Query = "<orderby><fieldref name="\&quot;Modified\&quot;" ascending="\&quot;"></fieldref><strong>FALSE</strong> \" /></orderby>";
view.Update();


::: good
Good Example - the Ascending attribute is using capital charactors as it is case-sensitive
