Returning a view that is named differently to the action confuses the MVC process and can make the code difficult to maintain.

<!--endintro-->

In cases where data is posted, if you don't do a redirect and the user hits the refresh/reload button in the browser, the data can be is submitted more than once. This can lead to duplicate data being stored in your database.

Redirecting after posted data has been processed is called the     [Post-Redirect-Get (or PRG) pattern](http&#58;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get).
<dl class="badImage">&lt;dt&gt;<br><br>::: greybox<br><pre>[HttpPost]
public ActionResult Create(CreateModel model)
&#123;
    // ... save to DB, then&#58;
    ViewBag.Message = &quot;Successfully created &quot; + model.Name;
    return View(&quot;Success&quot;);
&#125;

&#125;

public ActionResult Success(string message)
&#123;
    ViewBag.Message = message;
    return View();
&#125;
