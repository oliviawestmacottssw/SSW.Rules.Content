​There are two types of approval processes. One is quick and the other takes longer.<br>

​There are two types of approval processes. One is quick and the other takes longer. <div>&#160;</div>
<div><strong>Scenario 1 - Editing in Post</strong></div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>The first scenario assumes that you are filming something that requires later post production work (i.e. promo video, corporate videos, studio etc.). This scenario requires - depending on the type of video - a significant amount of time in post-production and therefore the approval process will take longer. These are the steps to follow&#58;</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<ol><li>After you have post-produced a first version of the video, you must get feedback from the product owner and the stakeholders </li>
<li>Make appropriate changes</li>
<li>Get a second round of feedback</li>
<li>Make appropriate changes</li>
<li>Get final sign off from Product owner</li>
<li>Upload and go live once all changes have been made</li></ol>
<p><strong>Scenario 2 - Editing Live</strong></p>
<p>The second assumes you are going ‘as live’. This is where you edit the video while record just like live television.</p>
<p>This scenario requires very little post production as this was completed during the filming</p>
<ol><li>Create all the assets needed (i.e. intro/outro slides) before the stream and insert them into <a href="http&#58;//www.xsplit.com/">XSplit</a> so that you can do a minimum amount of work in post as possible</li>
<li>Add intro and outro and make any quick edits if required in Premiere Pro</li>
<li>Get final approval from Product owner</li>
<li>Upload and go live</li></ol>
<p>By following this rule you can best assess what type of method you should use when creating a video. For example, if the video is an interview (basic two shot), use the Live option as you can do all the editing as you record/stream live.</p>
If however you are creating a creative video such as a corporate video or promo, then follow the traditional method in scenario 1 as these types of videos benefit from extensive post-production work.<br><p>&#160;</p>
