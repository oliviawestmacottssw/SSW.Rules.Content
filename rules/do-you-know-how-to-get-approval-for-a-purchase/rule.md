​​​When you need to spend money, don't assume you will get authorization – make sure you have approval before spending the money.<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Let's have a look at the best way to get authorization:</p><ol><li>Send an email to your boss, manager, or financial controller (or whoever the appropriate person is in your company) outlining what you want to purchase and why. </li><li>The email subject should be "Purchase Please - Request for xx" <br></li><li>If appropriate, include 2 or 3 quotes (call them "Option A, Option B etc") aiming to keep expenses low, and which you think is the best option</li><li>End the email with "Please approve"</li><li>Wait for an email back with "Approved" (prior to the purchase, or you may not get reimbursed later)</li><li>Forward a copy of the email to the financial controller with:<ul><li>Your manager's approval (in the history)</li><li>Attach the tax invoice</li><li>State how the payment was made (whether you paid it yourself and need reimbursing or if it was on a company credit card, and if so, which one)</li><li>If this is for a client, include the Client ID/name</li><li>If it is for a client, include if it is to be on-charged (E.g. please invoice - add 20%)<br></li></ul></li></ol><dl class="badImage"> <dt><img src="purchase-please-bad-example.jpg" alt="" /> </dt><dd> Figure: Bad Example - this expense will not be reimbursed </dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"> <dt><img src="purchase-please-good-example.jpg" alt="" /> </dt><dd> Figure: Good Example - this expense will be reimbursed, if David gets a reply from Adam</dd></dl><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Related Rule <br></h3><p></p><ul><li><a href=/do-you-manage-up> ​Do you manage up?
