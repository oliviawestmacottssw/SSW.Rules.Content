<h3>Schedule a Specification Review</h3> 
<p>For almost all projects, there is a need for additional requirements gathering. Some clients don't have any kind of specification, while the specifications you&#160;are given can sometimes be&#160;lacking in detail or incomplete. Accordingly, before you&#160;can provide an estimated&#160;price for completing the project, there is another step which requires engagement of your&#160;resources - the <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=8d7b1fab-5923-4e07-8da2-ba906053c056">Specification Review</a>.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Account Manager during the initial meeting to present the benefits of a Specification Review for the client. Following the initial meeting, the Account Manager will send a <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=8dc33f53-e08f-44d7-9304-ca7b3fe89296" target="_blank">brief proposal</a> in the form of a <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/templates/BriefProposalPostInitialMeeting.docx">Post initial meeting</a> email through to the prospective client for a Specification Review.&#160;</p><p>Note&#58; M​ake sure everyone who was in the meeting from your company checks the email&#160;before it's sent.</p><p>It may be necessary to conduct a second initial meeting with a technical specialist attending as well.&#160;</p><p>
   <span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">You may also find that some clients are unable to progress to a Spec Review until they have a vague ballpark. In these cases,&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">the sales person is to make the decision whether an extra 4 hours will be spent investigating the solution before the </span> <span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">ballpark is </span> <span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">given. This should then be sent as part of that &quot;Post initial meeting&quot; email mentioned above, with Spec review info swapped out for ballpark estimate info as required.</span></p><p>A sales person has 16 hours per month of developer time they can invest into this pre-sales investigation, so this time has to be used wisely.</p><p>Never offer a fixed price at the conclusion of an Initial Meeting, and this engagement model must be chosen before&#160;the Specification Review is done.​</p><p>More on the <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=8d7b1fab-5923-4e07-8da2-ba906053c056"> Specification Review</a>.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img alt="Send a brief proposal" src="/PublishingImages/Brief-Proposal-MrNorthwind.jpg" /> </dt><dd> Figure&#58; Send a&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/templates/BriefProposal.doc">brief proposal</a></dd></dl><h3>Ad-Hoc work/Consulting</h3>
<p>In the event the work is thought to be less than 3 developer days and the scope is well understood, it may be worthwhile for the developers to commence work straight away without a Specification Review. Normal standards for work should be followed, such as <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=731a3f5d-a266-4944-876c-a45afa82832f">daily scrums</a>. This type of work is called 'ad-hoc' work.</p><p>You&#160;may also immediately commence ad-hoc work if the client is a technical client and you&#160;are providing resources for an existing project under the sole direction of the client.</p>
