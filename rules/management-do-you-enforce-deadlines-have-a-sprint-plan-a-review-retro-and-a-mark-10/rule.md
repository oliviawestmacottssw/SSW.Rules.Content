Developers love doing things in their own time, investigating interesting things they find on the web, and therefore they're generally easily distracted. If they don't have a project plan constantly in front of them they'll never deliver on time! For every project you must have&#160;4 essential things&#58; 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <ol>
    <li>Enforce Deadlines - Every week (usually Tuesday) the developer has a meeting with the client to discuss the status of project. <br>
    Note&#58; If you can't have a meeting, a phone call must make do.<br>
    Note #2&#58; A weekly <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/ExtremeEmails/ManageProjects.aspx#StatusUpdate">status update report</a> (if the release is not yet complete).&#160; </li>
    <li>Have a project release plan -&#160;ideally a&#160;signed copy of the Release Plan in their diary.<br>
    Note&#58; A printed copy of the email with &quot;Approved&quot; is fine. </li>
    <li>A debrief when the release is done. </li>
    <li>A mark /10 - from the client.&#160;&#160;<br>
    &#160; </li>
</ol>
<p>In respect of the debrief, when thing have gone off the rails, it is easy to speak your mind and say what&#160;you believe went&#160;wrong.&#160;However often when things are going right, the tendency is to skip the debrief thing, with a comment 'all is good'. </p>
<p>A better idea is to figure out 'why are things are going right?', and work out how you can repeat it. For example, if your client calls and says, </p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; &quot;We think Dan has shown very professional conduct and has delivered a high-quality solution&quot;</p>
<p>you should look at how the project was run. Was the solution high-quality because your developer is a faster coder, or good at following your coding standards? Or was his professional conduct due to lots of customer interaction and polite and clear communication?</p>
<p>Of course, if in your release debriefing, if&#160;you find that the client is unhappy due to bad conduct, scope creep, or poor quality code, you need to check that your standards are being followed to ensure a positive experience in the next debriefing.</p>
