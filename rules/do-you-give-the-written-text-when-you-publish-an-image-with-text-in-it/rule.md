This is one of the most common errors tech bloggers do. Most bloggers do not think (or remember) to add more than just the image of the error screen capture.

If you add the text of the error message it will help others when they search, and help their Google juice.

Let's look at 3 examples:
<dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="BadExampleErrorMSG.jpg" alt="BadExampleErrorMSG.jpg"></dt><dd>Figure: Bad Example - this image gives no context of the surrounding areas, and without the text as well you get no google love</dd></dl><dl class="image"><dt><img src="OKExampleForErrorMSG.jpg" alt="OKExampleForErrorMSG.jpg"></dt><dd>Figure: OK Example - this image is great because it gives context by including the surrounding area, but you still need the text for SEO benefits</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="OKExampleForErrorMSG.jpg" alt="OKExampleForErrorMSG.jpg"><br><br>::: greybox<br>
