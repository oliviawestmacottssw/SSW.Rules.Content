  <p>Snapshots are a very convent way to back up a system before a big change is made. It is important to note that Microsoft does not support snapshots of running systems. This is because a snapshot is taken of the system exactly as is, with open connections and interrupt requests. For more information on this you can read Brian Harryâ€™s blog post here&#58; <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2010/02/10/a-tfs-2010-upgrade-success-story.aspx">http&#58;//blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2010/02/10/a-tfs-2010-upgrade-success-story.aspx</a></p>
<p>This is why you <strong>MUST </strong>shut down your server before taking a snapshot.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Shutdown the virtual server</li>
    <li>In the <strong>Hyper-V Manager</strong>, ensure the Virtual Machine has the state of <strong>Off</strong></li>
    <li>Right click on the virtual machine you wish to snapshot and click <strong>Snapshot</strong></li>
    <li>The snapshot should run very quickly and you will notice the snapshot in the <strong>Snapshots </strong>area of the <strong>Hyper-V Manager<br>

    <li>You can start your server back up again</li>
</ol>
