<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>All SharePoint customization and development must be done on a Virtual Machine. </p>
<ol>
<li>It's very important to correctly setup a SharePoint environment for development. Correctly configured, this will save you a lot of trouble later on. 
<li>From time to time, you can seriously damage a SharePoint installation during development and it is best not to install SharePoint on your everyday working machine. Additionally, when you start a new SharePoint project you don't want to carry all the luggage from a previous customization that could potentially affect your new project. 
<li>Virtual machines can be fired up and shut down easily 
<li>Virtual machines can be relocated on a different server and thus it doesn't waste developers' own computer resources 
<li>Virtual machines can be copied and brought to a client for demostration. 
<li>Very easy for someone to quickly create a new SharePoint server to quickly test or experiment with SharePoint. 
<li>Bad&#58; There might be more work required to activate additional servers. </li></ol>
