<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​​​​A good architecture diagram (aka a cloud architecture diagram or system architecture diagram) gives a great overview of your project. An architecture diagram lets you see at a glance what the overall structure of the solution is. This is useful for gaining an understanding of how the system fits together, how it flows, and what it does. It also helps to easily show which components can be improved due to updated or better components (or improved architectural guidelines).<br></p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify s4-wpActive">

   </p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Depending on the complexity of your solution and your comfort/familiarity with the tools, an architecture diagram could take you anywhere from half an hour to a couple of days.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Reference">Usually, the longer an architecture diagram takes you to make, the more important it is for your project.​<br> - Matt Goldman, Software Architect<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​An architecture diagram is part of the 7 crucial documents you need for your project, see our rule: <a href=/do-you-review-the-documentation>Do you make awesome documentation?​</a><br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​​Tip 1: Include your most important co​​​mponents<br></h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">At a minimum, your architecture diagram should include:<br></p><ul><li>Your data repository</li><li>Your business logic component</li><li>Your UI</li></ul>
   <span style="color:#333333;">Your diagram needs to include the relationships between these components, and how they share and process data.</span><br><br> 
   <h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​​Tip 2: Don't use a .NET Dependency Graph as a System Architecture Diagram<br></h3><p>​The .NET dependency diagram is a useful tool, but it drills down into a specific component of the solution (the code) while ignoring the rest of it (the infrastructure). If it adds value to your documentation (i.e., there is a specific reason to include it) you can include the .NET dependency diagram, but don't use it here in place of the architecture diagram.<br></p><p>​See SSW rule: <a href=/do-you-generate-the-vs-dependency-graph>Do you generate the VS Dependency Graph?​</a><br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea">

   </dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">​Figure: Bad Example - the .NET dependency diagram shows code dependencies, but not the application's architecture<br><br></dd><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​​​Tip 3: Show data dependencies and data flows<br></h3>Your architecture diagram should show how the components of your solution fit together. It should also show<strong> *how*</strong> the components of the architecture depend on each other for functionality, as well as upstream and downstream data dependencies.<br></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>

This gives an overview of the whole application in one diagram.<br></dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​Tip 4: Put data at the top<br></h3><p>​​It should be easy to tell at a glance which direction data flows in your diagram: left to right, right to left, 
      <span class="ssw15-rteStyle-Highlight">top to bottom </span>(recommended). Pick a direction for your data flow, and keep it consistent across all your documentation. Where there are exceptions (for example data going to analytics or to/from partner sources) make these perpendicular to the primary data flow direction.<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea">

   </dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​Figure: Good example - SugarLearning (an Angular + .NET project) - data flows from top to bottom, with exceptions (e.g. Application Insights / Raygun, not part of the main data flow) perpendicular to the primary direction<br><br></dd><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Tip 5: Group relevant components<br></h3><p>​Group components logically by enclosing them in a box. Components that operate independently can stand alone, and those that work together to deliver a logical function can be grouped together. Also show components that are out of scope, i.e. important for understanding the architecture but not necessarily part of it, e.g. legacy components, partner components, or components that have not been implemented yet.<br></p><p>Note: for clarity, out of scope items whether one or many, should be in a box.<br><br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea">

There's nothing wrong with starting out with pen and paper, but your hand-drawn sketch should not be considered your 'done' final architecture diagram. ** If you want to save paper, and increase collaboration, a great alternate is the trusty old Whiteboard.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Reference">For me its all about building a shared understanding between the client and the developers. Most pieces of software architecture I do, work starts by building a rough solution architecture diagram on a whiteboard. <br><br>Putting something on a whiteboard is "low risk" for the participants as its really easy to wipe and redraw. It allows us to start working together straight away, building a shared understanding of what we're trying to achieve. There is no software or skills required to participate in whiteboard collaboration. <br><br>A key milestone in the early engagement is the first time a client takes the pen and starts using the whiteboard to explain something to me. Early use of the whiteboard is all about immediate communication. Later, the solution design starts to solidify and we can then use the last state of the whiteboard to make out first architecture diagram.<br><br>- Brendan Richards, SSW Solution Architect</p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea">​<img src="IMG_9906.JPG" alt="IMG_9906.JPG" style="margin:5px;width:600px;height:800px;" />
