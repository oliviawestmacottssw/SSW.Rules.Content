<p>There are some SEO techniques that are quick and easy fixes, like being in a link farm. To join a link farm people pay to be part of a collection of web pages&#160; where their sole purpose is to provide interconnecting links and harvest pages ranking amongst members. Many of these &quot;get ranked quick&quot; methods have some serious repercussions. If you are caught in a link farm or have hidden text in your pages, you'll eventually get caught and sentenced with the Google &quot;death penalty&quot;. In some cases, entire domains were removed from the search engine indexes in order to prevent them from influencing search results. So after all is said and done a safe and sure&#160;way to increase your website's ranking is to provide useful information that other websites will want to link to. Google's concept&#160;of the Internet is that it should be filled with web pages&#160; that have high-quality information and based on this ideal,&#160;it rewards high-quality content and penalizes crud.</p>

Employing dodgy optimization techniques is a gamble; you're gambling that the smart people over at Google aren't as smart as you.â€‹</span></p>
