It might make sense in your environment to install a DPM Server inside a Virtual Machine. While it is supported by Microsoft, there are a few limitations you need to be aware of.

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <ul>
    <li>The Hyper-V role cannot be installed on the DPM server when it has been virtualized. This prevents you doing item level restores from inside Hyper-V virtual machines.</li>
    <li>You are unable to use hardware tape libraries inside the Virtual Machine. You are still able to use iSCSI or Virtual Tape libraries though.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further to this, it is also recommend that you use iSCSI or Pass-Through disks if you are going to be using DPM inside a Virtual Machine. Using VHDâ€™s in the storage pool is going to give you poor performance.</p>
