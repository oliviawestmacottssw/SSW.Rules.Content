The Product Owner is responsible for owning the Product backlog. See the video [here](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=a91de77d-a8dd-40be-b61a-bd6305e7183f):

There are three options for how to a add new PBI (Product Backlog item) to the backlog:

1. Emails​ <br>      Bad Example - This is a poor way to add a PBI as you can’t order emails by business prior​​ity​
2. **Visual Studio Team Services** - E.g. https://ssw.visualstudio.com 
 <br>​         ![image](RulesScrumUpdateBacklogGood.jpg "image")​​​​Figure: Good Example - VSTS allows you to enter an item into the backlog, in any priority order
3. **Team Companion (Recommended)
**![](RulesScrumUpdateBacklogBest.jpg)Figure: Team Com​panion lets you convert an email to a PBI, giving you the best of both worlds

​

Note: You can also create a PBI using VSTS and attach and email directly if needed, without using Team Companion
