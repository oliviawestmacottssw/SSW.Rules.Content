<p>A common source of pain, is picking up a project without a decent/complete handover. To have a successful project you must navigate over the problem of changing resources/people&#160;leaving etc.<br></p><p>As soon as an employee has given their resignation notice, their manager should become responsible for ensuring a successful handover takes place.&#160; Each project they were involved in should be reviewed and another employee with a matching skill set should be selected to receive the handover.&#160; Handovers should be booked in for each project with both employees in attendance, as early as possible and with high priority.</p><p>Once the handover is complete, the resigning employee should no longer work on that project so that any gaps in knowledge can be covered ideally before their notice period expires.<br></p><p>Always ensure that you&#160;complete the following checklist and <em>always </em>send the email confirming the handover is complete.</p><p>Here are the&#160;8 steps you should follow for a good handover. <br></p>
