        <b>Figure&#58; There is only one scenario where you would use a lead</b>
        <p>
          It is better to have all your contacts in one place rather than split over 2 separate
          tables. Leads are not needed except as a data entry tool to help you link new contacts,
          companies, and opportunities. See <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterCRMForUsers/Pages/Leads-can-be-converted-to-Opportunities-Contacts-and-Accounts.aspx">
            Quick Way to create and opportunity, contact and account in one step</a>.</p>
        <p>
          The only legitimate use of leads is for completely unqualified data, e.g.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You buy a contact database (too large to contact each one of them to qualify)</li>
        </ul>
