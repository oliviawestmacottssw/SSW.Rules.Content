Including images is a good idea, in addition when appropriate include code snippets,  and ideally have the code that changed highlighted in <font style="background-color:#ffff00;">yellow</font>.

An email with just the word "done" can often be enhanced with a screen capture or code snippet...
...it provides evidence
...it educates

<!--endintro-->

This has several benefits:

* Improved visibility and transparency - The client can see the work actually being done
* Reduced cost of fixing a bug - the cost of a bug goes up based of the length of time taken for the client to ask for a change. If you tell a developer to change something he did today, it is many times cheaper for him to fix, than if he got the same request 2 months later (when he has forgotten was it was about)
* The client can raise questions based on what he sees in the code
* Finally, in the very unlikely case that the code repository and backup goes corrupt, your emails are a backup!


Let's look at some examples and tips:
<dl class="badImage"><dt> <img src="NotifyCodeChangesBad.gif" alt="" style="width:620px;"> </dt><dd>Figure: Bad example - the client cannot see any detail of what was done </dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="NotifyCodeChanges.gif" border="0" alt="" style="width:592px;"> </dt><dd>Figure: Good example - the client can see the image + the code changes highlighted in yellow </dd></dl>
**Tip #1: Include the URL
** If you are using TFS, you can also include a URL to the work item in TSWA

 **Tip #2: Include a .diff file
** You can include the code as an attached text file.
<dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="NotePad2DiffFiles.gif" alt=""> </dt><dd>Figure: Good example - this is a Text file with a .diff extension that includes the code change from TFS. If opened using NotePad2, the client can view the code changes with green and red color (added and deleted code). </dd></dl>
**Tip 3#: Do you have force a link between the code and the requirement?**

For those developers lucky enough to be using Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS 2005, 2008 or 2010) you can associate your code changes with a work item. This means that future developers can work out not just \*what\* changed, but \*why\*. 
For those using TFS, enable the Checkin policy and force all developers to associate every check-in with a work item.
<dl class="image"><dt> <img alt=" " src="SourceControl_AssociateWorkItems1.gif">  <strong></strong> </dt><dd>Figure: Make developers associate all check-ins to a work items </dd></dl> <dl class="image"> <dt> <img src="SourceControl_AssociateWorkItems2.gif" alt="" style="width:563px;">  <strong></strong> </dt><dd>Figure: Enabling the Checkin Policy (via Project | Team Project Settings | Source Control | Add) </dd></dl>
