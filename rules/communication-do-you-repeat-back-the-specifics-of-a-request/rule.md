<p>Misunderstanding due to miscommunication can cause major disasters at work or in life (see&#58; <a class="external" href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/StandardsRules/Wikipedia.htm" target="_blank">http&#58;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_disaster</a>). A good communication strategy when receiving instructions is to repeat back what's being said to avoid misunderstanding. </p>
