Misunderstanding due to miscommunication can cause major disasters at work or in life (see: [Tenerife airport disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_airport_disaster)).

A good communication strategy when receiving instructions is to repeat back what's being said to avoid misunderstanding.
