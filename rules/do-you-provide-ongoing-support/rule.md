<h2>Handover, support and warranty</h2>
            
<h4>Implementing a Support plan</h4>
<p>
Just like a car, applications need servicing and tuning every now and then to stay in top condition. They might need 
alterations to deal with new business problems, or just tuning to increase efficiency based on changing user patterns.
</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Different clients need different levels of support. At SSW we offer a number of different <a href="http&#58;//www/ssw.com.au/ssw/Products/ProdCategory.aspx?CategoryID=8SUPP">support 
offerings</a>.</p>
   
<div class="greyBox">
<b>Important&#58;</b><br>When User Acceptance Testing(UAT) begins and there will be 30 days warranty period to test the application by the client and report any <b>bugs</b> back to us for free correction, after this warranty period, even bug fixing becomes chargeable. <b>During the warranty period, all feedback from clients should be moved to next release unless they fall into the </b> <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Redirect/SSW/RulestoSuccessfulProjects.htm">bug definition</a>. After all reported critical bugs have been fixed, you may generate a release plan for the next release and ask for approval to start a new release.</div>

<h4>Warranty on a Fixed Price Contract</h4>
<p>The Project Manager should review the specification, check off and test all items. This will determine whether (in his opinion) all items have been completed in totality.</p>
<p>The specification and project is handed over to a Tester (not a developer on the project) and the Tester reviews the specification, checking off and testing all items. He determines whether (in his opinion) all items have been completed in totality</p>
<p>Bugs and enhancements are made if required</p>
<p>When the Tester and the Project Manager are agreed that the project is completed&#58;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a Client Review has been scheduled into the specification send an email using (at SSW we use ClientDiaryCategory &quot;12 Fixed Price Handover (Review)&quot;)</li>
            <li>If a Client Review has NOT been scheduled into the specification send an email (at SSW we useClientDiaryCategory &quot;12 Fixed Price Handover (No Review)&quot;)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> The warranty period pauses when the client reports a bug. The warranty period resumes when a new version is sent. For example, the client may report a bug on a Wednesday morning on &quot;Day 18&quot; of the warranty. The bug is fixed on Friday and a new version is sent late in the afternoon. The warranty period resumes on Monday morning, at &quot;day 18&quot;. Therefore Wednesday through Friday were not included in the warranty.</p>
        <p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> There is no warranty on a time &amp; materials contract.</p>
<h4>Leaving Incomplete/Untested Work</h4>
        
        <p>If, at the end of the day, work hasn't been fully tested, or is incomplete and you haven't been booked in for the next day, speak to the Company Champion that issues may arise and further work is likely to be required. After the conversation, email the Company Champion and CC your manager to confirm that further work is required.</p>
                    <p>E.g. As per our conversation, this work has not yet been tested and may still include bugs. At this stage you would prefer if we did not continue work tomorrow, but I do recommend that we come in and finish soon.
                    </p>
