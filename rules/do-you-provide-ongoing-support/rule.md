<p>Just like a car, applications need servicing and tuning every now and then to stay in top condition. They might need 
alterations to deal with new business problems, or just tuning to increase efficiency.

<p>Different clients need different levels of support. Offer your clients a few different <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Products/ProdCategory.aspx?CategoryID=8SUPP">support offerings</a>.</p><ol><li>Ongoing Maintenance&#58; 1 day&#160;per week (or whatever quantity suits), a developer will work on enhancements and&#160;bug fixing. This is useful because the client always knows when work will next be done.</li><li>Maintenance Contract&#58; For 10% per year of the cost of the system you developed, all bugs will be fixed. This way your client will be guaranteed that the system will keep on running.</li><li>Time and Materials or Prepaid&#58; A client can simply call for bug fixing or support as and when needed. However, unless it's a show stopper, this model can involve waiting for developer availability.</li><li>Fixed Price Warranty&#58; For a fixed price project, a warranty commences after the Sprint Review. The warranty length is half the length of the sprint and, during this period, any bugs reported will be fixed for free.<br></li></ol><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​Warranty on a Fixed Price Contract</h3><p>Once the sprint review is complete, the Product Owner has half the sprint period again to report any bugs.</p><p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> The warranty period pauses when the client reports a bug that stops them testing further. The warranty period resumes when a new version is sent. For example, the client may report a bug on a Wednesday morning on &quot;Day 4&quot; of the warranty. The bug is fixed on Friday and a new version is sent late in the afternoon. The warranty period resumes on Monday morning, at &quot;Day 4&quot;. Therefore Wednesday through Friday was not included in the warranty.</p>
        <p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> There is no warranty on a time &amp; materials contract.</p><div class="greyBox"><strong>Important&#58;<br></strong>During the warranty period, all feedback from clients should be moved to backlog unless they fall into the <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Redirect/SSW/RulestoSuccessfulProjects.htm"><font color="#333333">bug&#160;definition</font></a>.​<br></div>
