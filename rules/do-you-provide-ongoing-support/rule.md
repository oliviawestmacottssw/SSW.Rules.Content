<p><strong>Implementing a Support plan&#58;</strong></p><p>Just like a car, applications need servicing and tuning every now and then to stay in top condition. They might need 
alterations to deal with new business problems, or just tuning to increase efficiency based on changing user patterns.

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Different clients need different levels of support. Offer your clients a few different <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Products/ProdCategory.aspx?CategoryID=8SUPP">support 
offerings</a>.</p><ol><li>Maintenance Contract&#58; 1 day a week (or whatever quantity suits), a developer will work on bug fixing and improvements.</li><li>Time and Materials or Prepaid&#58; A client can simply call for bug fixing or support as and when needed. However, unless it's a show stopper, often this model can involve waiting for developer availability.</li><li>Fixed Price Warranty&#58; For a period after the Sprint Review, (normally 14 or 30 days), bugs will be fixed for free. </li></ol><p><strong></strong>&#160;</p><p><strong>Warranty on a Fixed Price Contract</strong><br>The Project Lead should review the specification, check off and test all items. This will determine whether (in his opinion) all items have been completed in totality.</p>
<p>The specification and project is handed over to a Tester (not a developer on the project) and the Tester reviews the specification, checking off and testing all items. He determines whether (in his opinion) all items have been completed in totality.</p>
<p>Bugs are fixed and enhancements are made if required.</p>
<p>When the Tester and the Project Lead are agreed that the project is completed, the project is handed over to the client for testing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note&#58;</strong> The warranty period pauses when the client reports a bug. The warranty period resumes when a new version is sent. For example, the client may report a bug on a Wednesday morning on &quot;Day 18&quot; of the warranty. The bug is fixed on Friday and a new version is sent late in the afternoon. The warranty period resumes on Monday morning, at &quot;day 18&quot;. Therefore Wednesday through Friday were not included in the warranty.</li></ul>
        <p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> There is no warranty on a time &amp; materials contract.</p><div class="greyBox"><strong>Important&#58;</strong><br>When User Acceptance Testing (UAT) begins, there will be a 30 days warranty period for the client to test the application and report any <strong>bugs</strong> back to us for free correction, after this warranty period, even bug fixing becomes chargeable. <strong>During the warranty period, all feedback from clients should be moved to next release unless they fall into the </strong> <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Redirect/SSW/RulestoSuccessfulProjects.htm"><font color="#333333">bug definition</font></a>. After all reported critical bugs have been fixed, you may generate a release plan for the next release and ask for approval to start a new release.</div><h4>&#160;</h4><p>&#160;</p>
<strong>Leaving Incomplete/Untested Work</strong><br><strong>
        
        </strong><p>If, at the end of the day, work hasn't been fully tested, or is incomplete and you haven't been booked in for the next day, tell the Product Owner (PO) that issues may arise and further work is likely to be required. After the conversation, email the PO and CC your manager to confirm that further work is required.</p>
                    <p>E.g. As per our conversation, this work has not yet been tested and may still include bugs. At this stage you would prefer if we did not continue work tomorrow, but I do recommend that we come in and finish soon.
                    </p>
