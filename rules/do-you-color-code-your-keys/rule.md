<p>​Keys, we all have them. A key for the front door, a key for the garage, a key to the letterbox, and keys to your office… the list is often endless! How much time do you waste finding the correct key?​</p><p>​​<img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-colour-code-your-keys/keys%202.JPG" alt="keys 2.JPG" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;300px;height&#58;226px;" />​<br></p><p><strong>Figure&#58; Bad Example - a key bunch with no colour-coding, total anarchy!&#160;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>If you allocate each individual lock a colour and then tag or colour your keys to match, you can save a lot of time and effort identifying the correct key.<br><strong></strong><img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-colour-code-your-keys/keys%201.JPG" alt="keys 1.JPG" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;433px;height&#58;161px;" /></p><p><strong>Figure&#58; Good example - colour-coded your keys with labels, perfect order.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>TIP&#58;&#160;</strong>You can buy coloured key copies - so coding is even easier, no tags required!<br></p><p><br></p>
