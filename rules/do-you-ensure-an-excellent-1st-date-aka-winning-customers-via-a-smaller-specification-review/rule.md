So you had a good initial meeting (like a 1st coffee with a new girl), and you have agreed to have a Specification Review (aka first date).

For the majority of new clients, a [Specification Review](/spec-do-you-conduct-a-specification-review-%28ask-for-a-coffee-not-a-marriage%29) (also known as a Spec Review) will be your 1st paid engagement with them, and gives the client a [smaller first commitment](/Pages/Aim-for-an-advancement-rather-than-a-continuance.aspx). This is to work out the requirements and put together a broad time and cost estimate.

It is a simple 4 step process:

<!--endintro-->

1. Once you have decided that this is a project you want to work on, you have to convince the client to book in a Spec Review
    * This is a 1-5 day exercise for 1-2 people. The general rule is 1 man day per expected 2 week sprint.
    * This process is timeboxed, and so appears to the client as a fixed price.
2. Make sure you get [Terms and Conditions](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx) signed before you start work on this.
3. [Specification Review](/rules) - You will create a backlog of tasks, and some form of document (word or ppt) to present to the client explaining your proposed approach.<br><dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;<img src="ms-ppt-word-logos.jpg" alt="">&lt;/dt&gt;</dl>
4. Present the Spec Review results to the client (in a meeting with all stakeholders) on site if possible, or over the phone if not, but never just by email.
