Sometimes the person you send your email to may not reply immediately because they're busy or just may have forgotten about it.&#160; If you need an answer, use a RESEND by doing the following&#58;

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <ol>
    <li>Reply to ALL </li>
    <li>Put (RESEND) in 1<sup>st</sup> line of the Body </li>
    <li>Plus any other instructions - such as &quot;Hurry Up!&quot; </li>
</ol>
<img src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/HurryUp.gif" alt="Hurry Up" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" /><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58;&#160;Good Example - (RESEND) written at the top of the email.</span>
<p>This reminds the other person that you are still waiting for a response.</p>
