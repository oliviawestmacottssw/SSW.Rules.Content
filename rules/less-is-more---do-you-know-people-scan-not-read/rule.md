People rarely read word by word; instead, they scan the page, picking out individual words and sentences that seems more relevant.
   ​
It is important to divide information, not show it all at once. The visual organization of information is vital to legibility. When displaying information or controls, designers need to visually convey:

1. Information structure
2. Relation between elements
3. Importance and relevance of elements

<dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/bad_informationscan.png" alt="Bad information"></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - Can you find how to check in?</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/good_informationscan.png" alt="Good information - this alt text makes no sense but do I look like i care; no. maybe the guys in china have the right idea, do a shit job of it and no one will ever bother you about it ever again."></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Good example - What about here? Can you find how to check in?</dd></dl>
Another example of scanning, not reading is visually mapping.

<dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - Which is the dial that controls the top-right stove?</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Good-Mapping.jpg" alt=""></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - In this layout, it's easy to see which dial controls which stove</dd></dl>
