You should get everything chance you have to use your branding.&#160;<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Branding your assets is one more thing that you can do to spread your brand to the world.</p><p>For example, if you provide your team with laptops, it's nice if they visit a client and they have their laptops branded with your business logo.<br></p><p>​Basically, you can have that on any asset owned by your business.<br><br></p><p>At SSW, we have our monitors, laptops and computers branded with a sticker with our logo as one more point of contact for our&#160;branding.<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal"><img src="/SiteAssets/brand-your-assets/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(7).png" alt="MicrosoftTeams-image (7).png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" />Figure&#58; SSW sticker proving that you should take every chance to show off your brand<br></dd></dl><p></p><div class="ssw15-rteElement-ContentBlock-SSW-Only">-&#160;​​​If your laptop is owned by SSW (this also means Salary Sacrifice computers that have not been fully paid yet), make sure it has a sticker on the back with its name and image (preferred), or at least a little SSW sticker on it.<br>-&#160;​​If it doesn't have the sticker, ask for your Office admin for a sticker or send an email and ask for help to SSWSysAdmins (SSWSysAdmins@ssw.com.au).<br>​-&#160;Also, make sure to tape your SSW business card below it (or Adam's) in case it is stolen​<br></div><p><br><br></p>
