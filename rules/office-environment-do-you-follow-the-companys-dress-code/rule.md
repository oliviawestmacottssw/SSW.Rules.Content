<h3>Dressing Up</h3><p>One aspect of this is dress code. Dress code is important for two reasons&#58;</p><ul><li>Looking professional and keen for business<br></li><li>Reinforce&#160;the company's&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterBranding.aspx#BrandingEmployees">branding</a><br></li></ul><h3>Public Events and&#160;Meetings<br></h3><p>Of course, when&#160;in a&#160;public event&#160;such as a User Group, conference&#160;or seeing clients you should &quot;Dress Up&quot;.​<br></p><p>It should go without saying, but of course, things such as&#160;shaving off your weekend facial growth, using deodorant and having clean teeth and nice breath is assumed.</p><dl class="image"><dt>

<h3>On a business flight<br></h3>It's a good idea to&#160;&quot;Dress Up&quot; in flights as you never know who you will be seated next to.

It is free and easy to do and gives the team something to look forward to.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">E.g. At SSW, our&#160;employees&#160;<b>&quot;Dress Up&quot;</b>&#160;on Mondays and Tuesdays by wearing company colors,&#160;with a nice shirt (business or polo), trousers (not blue jeans), belt,&#160;nice&#160;shoes (no sneakers, joggers or thongs). So most employees wear their SSW shirts on Mondays.<br>Then they&#160;<b>&quot;Dress Down&quot;</b>&#160;later in the week... so they have 
   <b>&quot;Casual Thursday&quot;</b> and 
   <b>&quot;Sporty Friday&quot;</b>.<br></p><p>Thursday are casual clothes. On Fridays, they encourage sport clothes, such as shorts. It allows the end of the week to be fun.</p><dl class="image"><dt>​<img alt="SSW_Dresscode_Poster.png" src="/PublishingImages/SSW_Dresscode_Poster.png" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; ​<a href="https&#58;//www.dropbox.com/s/0sj1xn7av6sfz6w/SSW_Dresscode_Poster_A3.pdf?dl=0">SSW Dress Code can be downloaded here</a>.</dd></dl>
