<h3>Dressing Up</h3><p>One aspect of this is the dress code. Dress code is important for two reasons:</p><ul><li>Looking professional and keen for business<br></li><li>Reinforce the company's <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=f6b90f42-7f48-4c44-b766-295de647bb47">branding</a><br></li></ul><h3>Public Events and Meetings<br></h3><p>Of course, when in a public event such as a User Group, conference or seeing clients you should "Dress Up".​<br></p><p>It should go without saying, but of course, things such as shaving off your weekend facial growth, using deodorant and having clean teeth and nice breath is assumed.</p><dl class="image"><dt>

It is free and easy to do and gives the team something to look forward to.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">E.g. At SSW, our employees <b>"Dress Up"</b> on Mondays and Tuesdays by wearing company colors, with a nice shirt (business or polo), trousers (not blue jeans), belt, nice shoes (no sneakers, joggers or thongs). So most employees wear their SSW shirts on Mondays.<br>Then they <b>"Dress Down"</b> later in the week... so they have 
   <b>"Casual Thursday"</b> and 
   <b>"Sporty Friday"</b>.<br></p><p>Thursday are casual clothes. On Fridays, they encourage sport clothes, such as shorts. It allows the end of the week to be fun.</p><dl class="image"><dt>​<img alt="SSW_Dresscode_Poster.png" src="SSW_Dresscode_Poster.png" style="width:750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure: ​<a href="https://sswcom.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SSWDESIGN/EfVEIVvnUK5EoEE22SnqtskBlSE3nryQTkLDTjsfGrTV-Q?e=XijWyg">SSW Dress Code can be downloaded here (internal only)</a>​​<br></dd></dl><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Shorts Days - the cool exception<br></h3><p>On very hot days, shorts are allowed as soon as you've got an email like this:​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><b>Subject: SSW Sydney - 🩳 Shorts Today! (Over 30)<br>﻿ </b><br>Hi All,<br><br>The maximum temperature for today is 30.<br><br>Feel free to wear shorts if you like 🌞 (hope you haven't skipped leg day 😜)<br><br>If you decide against it, then don't forget the SSW dress code 👔 applies as usual (e.g. dress up on Monday and Tuesday - no jeans).<br><br>Today's forecast:<br>   > Sunny. Winds north to northwesterly 15 to 20 km/h turning west to southwesterly 20 to 30 km/h in the late morning and afternoon.<br>Note:<br>- At SSW, shorts day is on *only* if this email comes.<br>- Why? We don’t want people looking at different weather apps and having different rules apply... so if it’s over 30 but the email doesn’t come (e.g. there is a bug 🐞), then there’s no shorts that day.<br>Sophie<br><br>--Powered by SSW.Shorts<br><br>See the code: <a href="https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Shorts">https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Shorts</a><br>SSW Roles and Responsibilities - SSW.Shorts Master<br><br><This email was sent as per: <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=220f48f1-ccde-4a22-94f3-7b079f7b0551">https://rules.ssw.com.au/do-you-have-a-dress-code</a>></p>
