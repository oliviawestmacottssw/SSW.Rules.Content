<p>​​The way you and all members of your team present themselves is a crucial part of
                    creating a good impression for your clients, particularly in their first encounters
                    with you.

<h3>Dressing Up</h3><p> One aspect of this is dress code. Dress code is important for two reasons&#58;</p><ul><li>Looking professional and keen for business</li><li>Reinforce&#160;the company's&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterBranding.aspx#BrandingEmployees">branding</a></li></ul><p><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;"><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">E.g. At SSW, our&#160;employees</span>&#160;</span><strong style="line-height&#58;1.6;">&quot;Dress Up&quot;&#160;on Mondays and Tuesdays by wearing company colours</strong><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">...&#160;with a nice shirt (business or polo), trousers (not blue jeans)​, belt,&#160;nice&#160;shoes (no sneakers, joggers or thongs). So most employees wear their SSW shirts on Mondays​.​</span><br></p><h3>The Obvious​</h3><p>Of course when&#160;in a&#160;public​ event&#160;such as a User Group, conference&#160;or seeing clients you should &quot;Dress Up&quot;.​<br></p><p> It should go without saying, but of course things such as&#160;shaving off your weekend facial growth, using deodorant and having clean teeth and nice breath is assumed.</p><div class="greyBox"><p>&quot;There is nothing wrong with being the best dressed man in the room.&quot;</p><p></p><p> 
      <strong>Sean Connery</strong>​</p></div><h3>Dressing Down (aka Casual Fridays)</h3><p>Many companies find it a good idea to have Casual Fridays. It is free and easy to do and gives the team something to look forward to.</p><p>E.g. At SSW, our&#160;employees <strong>&quot;Dress Down&quot;&#160;later in the week... so they have &quot;Casual Thursday&quot; and &quot;Sporty Friday&quot;</strong>.</p><p>Thursday are casual clothes… on Fridays they encourage​ sport clothes, such as shorts. It allows the end of the week to be fun.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">​<img src="/PublishingImages/SSW_Dresscode_Poster.png" alt="SSW_Dresscode_Poster.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; SSW ​Dress Code​</dd>
