<ul class="p1"><li> 
      <span style="line-height:1.6;"> </span>Target platforms for the countries in which you’ll have either an e-commerce or on-the-ground presence. e.g. Facebook/Qzone, Twitter/Weibo.</li><li>Understand the specific social media websites and to craft the message for each  language. Always localize, don’t just translate. Google translate just isn't good enough, always give it to a native speaker to translate. </li><li>Don't make the text longer than what the shortest supported is (usually Twitter which is 140 characters).</li><li>Studies show that posts with an image get more traction .</li><li>Post it to the English site.</li><li>Then post it to the Chinese site.</li><li>
