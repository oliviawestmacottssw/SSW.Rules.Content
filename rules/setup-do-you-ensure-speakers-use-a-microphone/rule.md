<div>​​​It’s sometimes quite hard to hear who is speaking. Usually, the person leading the meeting is audible because they’ll be using&#160;a mic, but if others want to talk, they should come up next to the presenter and speak (if they are in the same room). This is important, as​&#160;people who are attending the meeting remotely can hear what is being discussed.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It’s worse when there are multiple conversations going on – let one person speak at a time, and make sure they’re close to the mic. No side conversations!​</div>
