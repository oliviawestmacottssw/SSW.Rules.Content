<p>Traveling around Sydney can take time and your time is best spent doing billable time in the office or at a client site. Taking a taxi is perfectly acceptable if it is going to save substantial time compared to taking public transport. This is applicable to travel between client sites or the office and a client site. Work <strong>does not pay</strong> for taxi travel from home to a client site, or home to the office. Remember to always obtain a Tax Invoice from the taxi driver so you can request for reimbursement later on.</p>
