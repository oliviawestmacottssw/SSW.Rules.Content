Not only software, carrying your own hardware and peripherals will save you hours one day&#58; network cables, cross-over cables, wireless cards, blank CD's, blank floppy's, software CD's, screw-drivers, even a text book or two. We have one guy in our office who carries two bags, each weighing about 10 kgs. He is the SSW St. Bernard!</p>
<p>A spanner might get a plumber through 90% of jobs, but he'll get stuck on the last 10% if he doesn't carry anything else. I carry <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/Favourite3rdPartyTools.aspx">these tools</a> in my Tool Box every day. I hope you find them useful.</p>
