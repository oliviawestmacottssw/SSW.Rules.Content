<ol>
<li>Let the client know what to expect in terms of communication, i.e. &#58; 
<ol>
<li>&quot;The first step is, we send you a release plan to approve. Once approved we can begin work&quot; 
<li>&quot;Every morning expect a 'Morning Goals' email with a list of tasks the developers will be working on that day&quot; 
<li>&quot;Every time a task is done, you will get an email with information about the task such as time taken, screen shots and code snippets&quot; 
<li>&quot;If you need to change the priority of a task, just let us know and we will consider it for inclusion either in this or the next release depending on its importance&quot;</li></ol>
<li>Avoid going more than 3 days without a phone call 
<li>If you are put onto an existing project, it is good practice to call the client and introduce yourself. For example, &quot;Hi, I'm Andrew. I'll be taking over from Mark on your project. Mark has filled me in on the specifics and I'm keen to get involved.&quot;</li></ol>
<p>If you maintain an open channel of verbal communication with your client, it helps to break down communication barriers, lets the client know that you are friendly and involved, and makes them feel confident in your ability to deliver the project.</p>
