<p>Ideally, all projects should be managed using Scrum, with sprint planning, reviews, and retros, daily scrums, sprint backlogs etc., but some client engagements are too short to justify this. <br></p><p>In these cases, as a minimum, there should be a backlog and a Kanban board, and the developer should still be doing daily Scrums with the client.&#160;<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>In order to ensure this, you should <b>schedule a &quot;Mini-Review&quot; once a week</b> for any client jobs that are too short or ad-hoc for a full scrum process. The client and the developer need to be in this meeting, and sometimes it might make sense to have it at the usual daily scrum time. <br></p><p>In this meeting, you should check the following&#58;<br></p><ol><li>Look at the board</li><li>Look at the backlog (if just using Kanban this might be the same as the board)</li><li>Ask what has been done since the last Mini-Review (or the start of the project)</li><li>Ask what will be worked on next</li><li>See if the current booking remaining is sufficient... i.e. book in more time as neededâ€‹<br></li></ol><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Ideally, the account manager would be a good person for this.<br></p>
