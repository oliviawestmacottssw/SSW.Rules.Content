<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Test Projects​​<br></h3><p>Tests should always live in separate projects – and you usually create a project from a template for your chosen test framework.<br>Because your test projects are startup projects (in that they can be independently started), they should target specific .Net runtimes and not just .Net Standard.<br>A Unit test project usually targets a single code project.</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Project Naming​<br></h3><p>Integration and unit tests should be kept separate and should be named to clearly distinguish the two.<br>This is to make it easier to run only unit tests on your build server (and this should be possible as unit tests should have no external dependencies)&#160;<br>Integration tests require dependencies and often won't run as part of your build process.&#160; These should be automated later in the DevOps pipeline.<br></p>

   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; In Jason Taylor’s Clean Architecture template, the tests are clearly placed in a separate location which makes it easy to deploy to production without them.&#160;It’s easy to tell which project is under test and what style of tests will be found in each test project.

<ul><li>Aim to make the body of the test easy to read with clear Arrange, Act, and Assert steps.</li><li>Use a good assertion library to make test failures informative</li><li>Use comments and refer to bug reports to document the “why” when you have a test for a specific edge-case.&#160;</li><li>Remember that the F12 shortcut will navigate from the body of your test straight to the method you’re calling.</li><li>The point of a naming convention is to make code more readable, not less - so use your judgement and call in others to verify your readability.<br></li></ul><dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/bad-naming.png" alt="bad-naming.png" />​</dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - From the test explorer view you cannot tell what a test is meant to test from the name</dd></dl><p class="ssw15-rteElement-CodeArea">
