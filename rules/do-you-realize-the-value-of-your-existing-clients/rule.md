<p>
                    It's often quoted in marketing circles that it costs between 60% and 600% more to
                    sell to new clients as opposed to existing ones. It makes sense then to nurture
                    your existing client relationships.
                </p>

<p>There are two strategies that need to be employed here&#58;</p>
<h4>Keep your current clients happyâ€‹</h4>
                <p>Feedback has been received&#160;from larger clients in the past that they expect regular
                    checkups and guidance from senior staff. A nice informal way to arrange this is
                    to buy your client lunch one a month. You can review the project for half an hour,
                    then grab a bite to eat. The review should cover the project as a whole, any niggling
                    problems, and discuss any upcoming projects. You should&#160;do this review free of charge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Project Manager, one of the most important things you should focus on to keep
                    clients happy is <i>communication</i>. For active clients, a week must not pass
                    without a phone call or some other contact. A lot of the time this will be emails
                    from the developer. Almost all disputes arise when you don't speak to a client for
                    a period of time. This allows any annoyances to fester and any misunderstandings
                    can turn into real problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A &quot;client relationship problem&quot; is when you have said &quot;no&quot; to
                    a client and and they let you know that they strongly disagree. In that case&#58;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tell them the reasons for your stand</li>
                    <li>Tell them that developers will sometimes do the wrong thing - clients have different
                        opinions of what that is</li>
                    <li>Tell them you are authorized to split a problem, offer them the solution and ask if they
                        are happy with that solution</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If they're still not happy you may need to refer them up the chain of authority.
                </p>
                <h4>Stay in touch with past clients</h4>
                <p>
                    Have a system in place that allows you to stay in touch with past clients,
                    even ones you&#160;may not have spoken to in a while&#58; send a useful newsletter
                    to subscribers so your business keeps fresh in their mind. That way when they suddenly
                    realise that they need some work done, you're right at the top of the list. Secondly,
                    have a follow up system in place so that client get a call every 3 months
                    after a job is completed. Make it friendly, not pushy.
                    You should use a line like 'I'm just checking in to see if everything is still running
                    smoothly.' Setting up a system like this will result in more repeat business and
                    less need to spend money on marketing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always be interested in your clients' lives outside of work&#58; find out about their hobbies, sports interests, 
                    kids etc. If you come up with the perfect idea for a present for an important client, get it approved by 
                    your manager and send it off.
                </p>
