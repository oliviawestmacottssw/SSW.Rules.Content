Every now and then your clients are going to want to change their priorities​ and have you work on something which they see as more important than some of the items in&#160;your current sprint.&#160;Provided that it doesn't have any negative effects overall, there isn't any reason why you can't stick to the &quot;customer is always right&quot; philosophy.<br><br>So what will you do when this happens? ​
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ol><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Double check that this new item is more important than the current sprint items (if not add it to the product backlog instead​)</span></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Add the new PBI to the current sprint&#160;</span></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;20px;">&#160;Remove another item of similar size off the sprint and back to the backlog</span><br></li></ol>

<p>​<br></p><p>In the rare case where the entire sprint goal and all PBIs are no longer high priority, you can instead cancel the entire sprint and start again&#58;</p><ol><li>Move any left over work/items to the backlog. </li><li>Send a debrief to the client with a note e.g. As per your request we have just cancelled Sprint five and will start on Sprint six. The remaining items have been moved into the backlog. </li><li>Send a Sprint&#160;Forecast for the new sprint</li></ol><p>This should only be done in extreme circumstances as it is traumatic to the team.</p>
