<p>​While working in a team, there&#160;are three ways of seeing others' or team calendars.​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3" style="text-align&#58;left;">Option 1&#58; Using Outlook Calendar Permissions&#160;- See&#160;a person's calendar<br></h3><p>You can share your Outlook calendar with another&#160;person or a group in&#160;Outlook. This option is useful when you want to share your personal calendar with others.<br></p><p>See&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=86a7e3f1-964a-47bc-ba84-d28bd42d3df4">https&#58;//rules.ssw.com.au/calendar-do-you-allow-full-access-to-calendar-admins</a>&#160;for step by step instructions on how​&#160;to share your calendar or see another person's shared calendar.<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Option 2&#58; Using the Dynamics&#160;365 CRM&#160;Service Calendar - See&#160;everyone's calendar<br></h3><p>When you want to see what's your colleague is doing, you can use the CRM Service Calendar.<br></p><p>This can&#160;keep track of important things like client w​ork and leave.&#160;See&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=d51b4fd0-dc73-4e51-a6fd-e2354b6add89" target="_blank">Scheduling - Do you know how to book developers for a project?</a>&#160;on how to add a booking to CRM Service Calendar.</p><dl class="image"><dt>

   <b>Note&#58;</b> This will only show appointments that have been tracked in CRM. 
   <br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3" style="text-align&#58;left;">Option 3&#58; Using SharePoint's calendars - See a&#160;team's calendar<br></h3><p>You&#160;can also create a calendar in&#160;SharePoint which will be shared with the&#160;team on that SharePoint site.&#160;By sharing a&#160;calendar using SharePoint, new developers who have just joined the team can immediately&#160;look at the project's events (e.g. Daily Scrum meeting).<br></p><p>In this scenario, the scrum master of &quot;SSWSugarLearning&quot; wants to share the&#160;calendar called &quot;Team Calendar&quot; with his&#160;team.<br></p><p>To share a team calendar, you just need to give the calendar URL to the&#160;person in your team.<br>​E.g. https&#58;//sswcom.sharepoint.com/sites/SSWSugarLearning391/Lists/Team%20Calendar/calendar.aspx</p><p>
   <strong>Tip&#58; </strong>You can also connect the SharePoint calendar to your&#160;Outlook. Here's how to do that&#58; 
   <br></p><dl class="image"><dt>

   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; In SharePoint 2016&#58; On the &quot;Calendar&quot;&#160;tab, click &quot;Connect to Outlook&quot; to show&#160;the calendar in&#160;your Outlook account<br></dd></dl>
