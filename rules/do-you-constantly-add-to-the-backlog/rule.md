  <p>In the course of work everyone encounters bugs or problems. They can be dealt with by either&#58;<br></p>
<ol>
    <ol>
        <li>Pretend you didn't see the problem </li>
        <li>Fixing it straight away </li>
        <li>Add the issue to the backlog so someone else can fix it </li>
    </ol>
</ol>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>The best solution is to use a combination of 2 and 3. </p>
<ul>
    <li>If it will take less 15 mins to fix, do it straight away. </li>
    <li>If it will take more time, add the problem to the product backlog and email a link to the appropriate person (even if itâ€™s a third party product).<br></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach raises the question of priorities. If you hit too many hurdles you continually get diverted from the main task&#58; for example when fixing&#160;the Client form&#160;you encounter a problem with the Client Contact form which breaks&#160;the Products form&#160;etc. (This can be described as the &quot;Tree Approach&quot; as opposed to the &quot;Straight through to the Goal approach&quot;.)</p>
<p>You need to try to balance short term productivity with long term improvements. My view is that it is better to get 2 things done at 100% than get 4 things done at 75%! At a minimum, always add the issue to the backlog.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
