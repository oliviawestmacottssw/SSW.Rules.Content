​Here are the first things you should do EVERY time you come off client work&#58;
<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <ol>
    <li>Get a reference from the last client
    <ul>
        <li>It is a good way to check the client is happy </li>
        <li>If your company is a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, these references can lead to competencies such as Custom Development Solutions and ISV/Software Solution </li>
        <li>An example of what to say to the client is&#58; &quot;We are a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner and I would like to submit a short description of the project to Microsoft, you will receive an email from Microsoft asking you to approve the reference. How does that sound?&quot; </li>
        <li>We would also love a testimonial to add to our website. Would you be happy to give a testimonial for the work we've done for you? Can you please email it to me?<br></li><li>If there is going to be further work down the line​, ask to pencil in a booking for say a month's time or so​, so that you don't get too booked out by other clients.<br></li></ul></li></ol>
<ol start="2">
    <li>The next thing to do is to call your last few clients. You should always be in contact with them at least every 6 months
    <ul>
        <li>Before the call always prepare.
        <ul>
            <li>Refresh your memory about the company, project and contact before calling (have a look at their website; have a look at their competitors etc.) </li>
            <li>Check the upcoming events (Check the calendar on the Home Page to see what's coming up) </li>
            <li>Know the topic of the upcoming user group </li>
            <li>Draft out some suggestions in an email (don't send yet) </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Decide on what value-add opportunities you are going to offer them. Some examples&#58;
        <ul>
            <li>A relevant and useful URL of an article </li>
            <li>Mention something relevant to their project from a User Group presentation you saw </li>
            <li>Maybe you can also invite them to a free Tech Breakfast </li>
            <li>Maybe an upcoming User Group would be useful. It's a good place to have free training, and to build contacts and socialize (lots of IT managers and developers). Email the <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/Default.aspx">User Group</a> link </li>
            <li>Ask them about their website. See if any work needs to be done - Mention the need for <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesTuningAndMaintenance.aspx">maintenance</a> </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Call and chat to them about the work you did with them. Ask how everything's going, and if the application was successful
        <ul>
            <li>If yes - great, see what else you can do. </li>
            <li>If not - then find out why (was it a technical issue, or the app not meeting the business needs) and offer to improve it. You can offer them a free consultation with one of our account managers. </li>
            <li>Take some notes on what they liked about the solution. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Always ask if they know of some other projects we could help them with, or if they know of anybody that may need some software development gurus. </li>
        <li>Send a follow up email
        <ul>
            <li>Send an &quot;<a href=/do-you-send-as-per-our-conversation-emails> as per our conversation</a>&quot;. Include some of your notes, a thank you for the time, and CC the Account Manager. If they were interested in a consultation, then ask the Account M​anager to follow up<br></li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
