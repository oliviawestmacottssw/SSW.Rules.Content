 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
A Like Page should be available for each popular product or entity of your company. SSW has a fan page for the Rules section of our company but not a fan page for each individual product; on the other hand, it would be suitable for Microsoft to have a separate page for each of their products.

Figure: One of these pages is probably unnecessary. 
Whether your product or entity requires a Like page depends largely on how effectively it will reach your target audience. Such pages usually have a high upkeep as you need to spend time to maintain your public image, responding to comments and posting updates reliably. It can be a profitable maneuver, but if this style of social networking does not reach out to your audience, then maintaining it is needless.
