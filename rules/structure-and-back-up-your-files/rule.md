<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">It is important to back up your work regularly to a separate location to prevent any loss of data. Ideally, back-ups are saved to a server or cloud-based file storage for ease of access.​​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">When building projects, ensure that files and folders are labeled clearly. For example, use different folders for different file types - footage, images, exports, and projects, etc. This ensures that another team member (or your future self) can easily find all the assets associated with the project. File structures should be consistent – both among team members and over time.<br></p>

In a team environment, this system can also incorporate file ownership with different users.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>​<img src="structure-back-up-files-bad-example-1.jpg" alt="structure-back-up-files-bad-example-2.jpg" style="width:750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure: Bad Example - A singular project folder, with some project, files also sitting outside it</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>​<img src="structure-back-up-files-bad-example-1.jpg" alt="structure-back-up-files-good-example-2.jpg" style="width:750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure: Good example - There are dedicated folders for projects that are in progress and completed</dd></dl><p>File names are also very important - they are the principal identifier of a file. They need to include information about the content and context of the file.​<br></p><p>Always use version numbers when saving – don’t use the word ‘final’. It is much easier to follow the progression of a project with numbers, both to find the latest version or to revert back to a previous one if needed.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>​<img src="structure-back-up-files-bad-example-1.jpg" alt="structure-back-up-files-bad-example-3.jpg" style="width:750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure: Bad example - Items are not named clearly and it is difficult to know what file is the correct export</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>​<img src="structure-back-up-files-bad-example-1.jpg" alt="structure-back-up-files-good-example-3.jpg" style="width:750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure: Good example.
