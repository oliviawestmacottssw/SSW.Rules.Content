Tracking expenses can be a painful process of accumulating receipts and entering them into outdated systems… but there is a better way. 



Various apps help solve the above problem. Using a modern Accounting system such as Xero, some connected apps can be used in conjunction with the accounting system and they include:


* [Hubdoc](https://www.hubdoc.com/)
* [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/)
* [Receipt Bank](https://www.receipt-bank.com/au/)


It may be difficult to determine which app would be best suited for your business so below is a comparison of some of the major features of each app.







| Features (based on 5 users)<br> | Receipt Bank<br> | Hubdoc<br> | Expensify<br><br> | Preferred Option<br> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pricing<br> | $360/annual<br> | Free with Xero<br> | $840/annual (minimum)<br> | Hubdoc <br> |
| Submission Procedure<br><br> | Phone App – take a photo and submit it to the Receipt Bank email OR forward an email to the Receipt Bank email. <br> | Same as Receipt Bank<br><br> | Same as Receipt Bank<br><br> | No preference – the same procedures with all.<br> <br> **Figure: Hubdoc email for receiving** <br><br> |
| Restriction on Invoice uploads <br> | 300/mo<br> | Unlimited<br> | Unlimited<br><br> | Hubdoc and Expensify<br><br> |
| Back-up<br> | Unlimited – Never deletes and remains archived<br> | Unlimited – use cloud back up and security. Never deletes <br> | Unlimited – Never deletes and remains archived<br> | Hubdoc – the added security just seems better<br> |
| Organising<br> | No real organization of documents. Either inactive or archived and ordered in date/supplier order<br> | Requires greater access than uploader only. Automatically organized into folders (can be updated). <br> | Can be manually organised into folders or reports. <br> | Expensify as Hubdoc requires greater access<br><br> |
| Expense Rules<br> | Automate rules (or after the first occurrence) as to where expenses are to be accounted to (account categories) <br> | Same as Receipt Bank – however seems to only be on each invoice (can’t create outside of existing invoice – not that important)<br> | Same as Receipt Bank – little easier to navigate to the section <br> | Expensify <br> |
| Accounting Codes<br> | Syncs with Xero account categories and automatically chooses those options. Brings bank reconciliations of these invoices to 90% of the way<br> | Same as Receipt Bank<br> | Not available at $840/annual. If the business wants to use this, the subscription plan will be $1800/annual.<br> | Receipt Bank or Hubdoc<br><br> |
| Receipt Fetch<br> | Ability to integrate with most common suppliers (utilities, banks and some more). Automatically grabs any new invoices and pushes to Receipt Bank<br>https://help.receipt-bank.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005754174-List-of-Suppliers-for-Invoice-Fetch <br> | More options than Receipt Bank and more major suppliers<br> <br>https://go.hubdoc.com/hubfs/HubdocLiveAUConnections.pdf<br> | Limited options https://use.expensify.com/all-integrations<br> | Hubdoc<br><br> |
| Phone Compatibility<br> | iPhone, Android and Web-based <br> | All Phones <br> | All Phones<br> | Hubdoc or Expensify<br> |
| Two-factor Authentication<br> | No<br> | Yes<br> | No<br> | Hubdoc<br> |
| How-to Videos<br> | No<br> | Yes<br> | Yes<br> | Expensify - has more videos<br> |


 **Overall, Hubdoc is a clear winner.** Additional to the above, Hubdoc is allowed unlimited users when connected with Xero.



To improve on the function of these apps, it is recommended to set-up default receiving emails that users can either forward all invoices to that email or just take a photo with the app which is stored within the app.

We can also do the vis versa, so all invoices going to a hubdoc default email can be forwarded back to a company internal email for reference.

Expense apps are a timesaver, both for the day to day user, as well as the accountant receiving the expenses.

As a user, all you have to do is take a photo of the receipt from your mobile app and add a comment (all other data is pulled in via OCR “Smart-scan”), then all of these expenses get batched together and sent on a weekly basis to the accountant, who can then manage them in bulk. 
Best of all… for light users… it’s free!
