So when you add someone, it is a good idea to state the reason why they are being added, so it&#160;will justify the cost of their time.</div><div>&#160;eg.&#160;<span style="line-height&#58;23.4000015258789px;">(Adding Drew to the loop as during the daily scrum today he mentioned he has&#160;worked on similar issues and might have some input)</span></div>​<br>
