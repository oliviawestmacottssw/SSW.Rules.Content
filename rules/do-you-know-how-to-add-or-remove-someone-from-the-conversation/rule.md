If you think someone should be involved in a conversation but they're not on the recipient list, all you need to do is reply all, put the new recipient in the 'CC' field, and include one line that says &quot;I'm adding this person into the loop because I think they may have some input.&quot;

<p>If you need to remove someone from the loop, for example to have an internal conversation about an email to a client, put (Removing xxx from the loop) at the top of the email.</p>

<p>You can delete people from an email thread, but what often happens is&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>The people being dropped won’t know and won’t be able to say &quot;I don't want to be dropped from this thread&quot;</li>
<li>The people who added them in the 1st place don't know that they included unnecessary people</li>
<li>The others on the thread might not notice the change in email addresses</li>
</ul>
<p>To fix all these issues, instead of deleting people from the email, you&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>Move them to the BCC</li>
<li>On the top line of the body say &quot;(moving George and Bob to BCC)&quot;</li>
</ul>
