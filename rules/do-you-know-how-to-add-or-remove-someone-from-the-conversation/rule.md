If you think someone should be involved in a conversation but they're not on the recipient list, all you need to do is reply all, put the new recipient in the 'CC' field, and include one line that says &quot;I'm adding this person into the loop because I think they may have some input.&quot;

<p>If you need to remove someone from the loop, for example to have an internal conversation about an email to a client, put (Removing xxx from the loop) at the top of the email.</p>
