<p>
          Step 1 - What data?
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Don't take all the data for the first release - Usually there are huge amounts
            of data in legacy systems - take only the most important firstly.</li>
          <li>Using the planning spreadsheets included with the <a target="_blank" href="http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20015">
            Microsoft CRM Data Migration Pack</a> - they are excellent for specifying data migration
            field mappings.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Step 2 - Sync or import?</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Syncing and keeping the old system live is the preferred option</li>
          <li>Consider writing .NET callouts - or consider Scribe Insight</li>
        </ol>
