  <p>You should always publish your blog posts to Twitter. It helps boost traffic and visibility for your site.<br></p>
<p>Make it automatic. You do not need to do this manually, there are services out there that will monitor your blogs RSS or ATOM feed and publish when you do.</p>
<p>The best one is&#58;</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//twitterfeed.com/" target="_blank">TwitterFeed</a> - This offers a dedicated established service that will publish your feed to Twitter and Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, this automated service does not automatically add hashtags. (Suggestion&#58; they should take this from your &quot;categories&quot; or &quot;labels&quot; that you use to tag your posts).</p><p>So the solution is to &quot;double tweet&quot; your blog post, adding useful hashtags.</p>
