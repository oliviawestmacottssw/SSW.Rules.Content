You should always publish your blog posts to Twitter. It helps boost traffic and visibility for your site.

Make it automatic. You do not need to do this manually, there are services out there that will monitor your blogs RSS or ATOM feed and publish when you do.

The best one is:
    
- [TwitterFeed](http&#58;//twitterfeed.com/) - This offers a dedicated established service that will publish your feed to Twitter and Facebook.


Unfortunately this automated service does not automatically add hashtags. (Suggestion: they should take this from your "categories" or "labels" that you use to tag your posts).
 So the solution is to "double tweet" your blog post, adding useful hash tags.

Do you know the minimum builds to create on any branch? [http://bit.ly/aXeGmU](http&#58;//bit.ly/aXeGmU)    1:51 AM Mar 19th   via twitterfeed
Bad example - Leaving only this automated one, that came from twitterfeed (missing hash tags)

Good example - Adding hash tags to your automated tweet
