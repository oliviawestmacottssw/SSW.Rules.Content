<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">You should always publish your blog posts to&#160;all social media platforms you use​. It helps boost traffic and visibility for your site.&#160;​​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Don't simply share the URL and maybe the title, as it won't make people get interested in taking an action. On social media, nowadays, you have an average of 5 seconds to get someone's attention on the feed – sometimes even less than that. So, you should put the effort in carefully choosing a catchy image to make your blog post interesting visually on someone's feed and adapting the content to different social networks. For example, if you use Twitter, you will have fewer characters. A good starting point is to choose a statement or a statistic from your blog post to share on the social media post and give the user a snippet about the content they are about to read.&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">The combination of a good image and an explanatory caption providing enough (and interesting) information from your content will make the user want to visit your blog to find out more about what you have to share.<br></p>
