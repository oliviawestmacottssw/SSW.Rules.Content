<p>Communication can be difficult &#160;(even if English is your first language!).&#160;It might be tempting to only communicate via IM, but this will not improve your skills or build a relationship as well as communicating verbally.<br></p><ol><li>Stop&#58; Just using IM</li><li>Start&#58; Asking ‘Can I call you?’&#160;<br>...<br></li><li>Start&#58; Using video call (if weak bandwidth just use it for the first 10 seconds)</li><li>Start&#58; Make up for weak English by typing while speaking <br></li></ol><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/skype-conference.jpg" alt="skype-conference.jpg" /> <br>

Sound - Check the sound quality of the microphone - you need a good mic and it should be close to your mouth - if you are using the laptop mic, sit in close.<br>4. Video - Check the image quality of the camera. Beware of the angle of the camera - the ones with thin bezels now put the camera at the base, looking up your nose. Avoid them.<br>5. Consider what is in the background (**link to the rule to better video on this one)<br>6. Help the other person by taking a screenshot and giving them a mark /10 with good and bad feedback of the call quality&#160;and background.<br><br></li></ol>
