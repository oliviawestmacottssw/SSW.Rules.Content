<p>Always indicate which fields are required. Users get frustrated when they experience a wasted trip to the server, just because they did not get an obvious indication of what was required first time around.</p>

However if you are in doubt and don’t have a designer around, a red asterisk is definitely the best option.</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="Redstar_Good-example.jpg" alt="Use a simple asterisk character" /></dt><dd>Figure: Good Example - A visual indication of what fields are required (use a red asterisk if you are not a designer)</dd></dl><h4>More Information</h4><p>You should combine these visual indicators with appropriate client and server side validators to make sure that your data conforms to business requirements. Adding a RequiredFieldValidator to the above textboxes gives you data validity check with minimal coding.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt><p class="ssw15-rteElement-CodeArea"><asp:Textbox runat="Server" ID="email" /></p></dt><dd>Figure: Bad Example - No validator used, so the user won't know the email is required</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><p class="ssw15-rteElement-CodeArea"><asp:Textbox runat="Server" ID="email"/>
