This is a very important concept, just because you get answered no, it does not mean that it is a bad idea, or that it will not benefit the company. You may get the answer 'No' for reasons that you do not know about, such as financial difficulties, or it is too busy at the moment to worry about. You should make these ideas into a list, and remember to bring them up with the boss at a more appropriate time. If you are not satisfied with the result, talk to your boss about your idea, so you understand why they made the decision they did. It is important however to realize that not all ideas are good ideas and you will have to accept that when you get it wrong.
