â€‹Do you sometimes find that people don't attend to all the items you have listed in your long and carefully drafted email? <br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Make it easier for everyone to track the status of tasks by sending&#160;tasks one email at a time, and make the&#160;requests very clear. When a person has completed a task they just have to reply &quot;Done&quot; to that email, delete the email from their inbox and then move on to the next task.<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Grouping related tasks&#160;<br></h3>
<p>Obviously, if you are requesting many&#160;small changes to the same page, use one email as they're related to the same topic. In this case&#160;number each task that you wish to be completed, as per &quot;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=072d00e3-9704-4c03-acc5-81b449d27a1c">Do you number small tasks related to 1 topic</a>&quot;. If all the tasks are very simple and everything was done as specified,&#160;the person who completed the tasks&#160;replies with a single &quot;Done&quot; to the whole email.<br></p><p><b>Warning&#58;</b> Don't group unrelated&#160;topics<br></p><p><img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="GOOD - Exception to the rule." src="/PublishingImages/relatedTasks.gif" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58;&#160;Good Example - A few related tasks in one email</span></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Breaking up monster tasks <br></h3>
<p>If you have&#160;a very large task&#160;that requires days of work, it is better to break it up and send separate emails. So that a task &quot;Boil the Ocean&quot; would become&#58;</p><ul><li>&quot;Boil the Ocean #1&quot;,&#160;</li><li>&quot;Boil the Ocean #2&quot;,&#160;</li><li>&quot;Boil the Ocean #3&quot; etc.<br></li></ul><p>The advantages are that you get an email history on a specific part and it is easier to include someone else. <br><br></p>

Don't&#160;consolidate them all into one as it leaves unfinished email threads. <br></p><p><br></p>
