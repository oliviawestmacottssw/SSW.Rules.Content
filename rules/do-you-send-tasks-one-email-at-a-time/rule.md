Do you sometimes find that people don't attend to all the items you have listed in your long and carefully drafted email? 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>Make it easier for everyone to track the status of tasks by sending tasks one email at a time, and make the task it requests very clear. When a person has completed a task they just have to reply &quot;Done&quot; to that email, delete the email from their Inbox and then move on to the next task.</p>
<p>This rule can be by-passed when dealing with small tasks relating to the same topic. In cases where this is needed, you should number each task that you wish to be completed, as per &quot;<a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/NumberSmallTasks.aspx">Do you number small tasks related to 1 topic</a>&quot;. however, the person completing the task should still reply a single &quot;Done&quot; to the whole email once they have completed all of the small tasks.</p>
<p>Also send separate emails per topic - that way there can be one email per topic. The advantages are that you get an email history on a specific topic and it is easier to include someone else. </p>
