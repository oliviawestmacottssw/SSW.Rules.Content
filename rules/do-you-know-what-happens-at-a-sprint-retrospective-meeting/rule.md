  <p>At the end of every Sprint the Development&#160;Team performs a Sprint Retrospective also&#160;known as the Retro.&#160;The Retro&#160;provides an opportunity for the Scrum&#160;Team&#160;to reflect on what has gone well, what has gone poorly, and what the team wants to change.&#160;</p>
<p>Inspect-and-adapt is a key component of the Scrum framework and the Retro&#160;gives Scrum Teams an opportunity to learn from their&#160;successes and&#160;mistakes.</p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<div>The Retro is a time-boxed event that focuses around 3 questions&#58;</div>
<div><ul><li>What went well?</li>
<li>What didn't go well?</li>
<li>What will we do differently in the next Sprint?</li></ul></div>
<div></div>
<div>The Scrum Master facilitates the meeting and&#160;collects issues as they are raised.&#160;Once every Scrum Team Member has spoken he&#160;facilitates debate on each issue&#160;so that team consensus is achieved.&#160; The result should produce an actionable outcome, for&#160;example&#58;</div>
<ul>
    <li>An adjustment&#160;is made to the daily processes followed by the Scrum Team</li>
    <li>An adjustment is made to the <a href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/RetrospectiveMeeting.aspx">Definition of Done</a></li>
    <li>An adjustment is made at the organisation level</li>
    <li>An item is added to the Product Backlog</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height&#58;18px;">To help aid&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;18px;">dis</span><span style="line-height&#58;18px;">cussion&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;18px;">i</span><span style="line-height&#58;18px;">t can be useful for the<span></span>&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;18px;">Scrum Master to pr</span><span style="line-height&#58;18px;">epare&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;18px;">items for&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;18px;">review by inspecting</span><span></span><span style="line-height&#58;18px;">&#160;the Sprint Backlog&#160;</span>and&#160;statistics such as Code Coverage. For example the Scrum Master can find&#160;<span style="line-height&#58;18px;">User Stories in the Sprint&#160;that were&#160;successful&#160;/ not successful&#160;and then facilitate the discussion as to why.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p>Once all issues have been discussed to the satisfaction of The Scrum Team, the meeting concludes.<br>
<br>
If the timebox limit is reached, the remaining issues should be recorded and dealt with by the Scrum&#160;Master.&#160; Any&#160;outstanding issues must be&#160;raised at the next Retrospective if they are still relevant.<br>
<br>
The time-box for this meeting is usually as many hours as weeks in the Sprint.</p>
