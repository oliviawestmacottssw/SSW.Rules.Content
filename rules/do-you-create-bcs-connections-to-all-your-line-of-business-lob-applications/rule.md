In SharePoint 2007, we have Business Data Catalog to connect SharePoint to other line of business applications.  <br>
When you connect your other systems to SharePoint you can then have one central place to see your data&#58;<br>
<ol>
    <li>
    Microsoft CRM connected to SharePoint allows you to search for CRM contacts from SharePoint
    </li>
    <li>TFS connected to SharePoint lets you see the project documents and reports via SharePoint
    </li>
    <li>Your roster system connected to SharePoint allows you to see those calendars in SharePoint
    </li>
</ol>

In SharePoint 2010 â€“ the Business Data Catalog is upgraded to the new Business Data Connectivity Service (BCS).<br>
<ol>
    <li>
    It is a lot easier to plug-in
    </li>
    <li>Supports not just READ operations, but delete, update and create operations as well.
    </li>
</ol>
