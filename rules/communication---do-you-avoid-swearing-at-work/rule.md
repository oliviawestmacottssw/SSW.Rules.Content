​​​Swearing is not acceptable at work. People should not get comfortable with bad language as the work environment would suffer. You should be especially careful when giving and receiving feedback.​​

Some good deterrents are:​
 
- A swear jar
- To enforce 10 push-ups for every infraction ​(recommended). ​
This is the same concept as a swear jar but also promotes fitness.​
