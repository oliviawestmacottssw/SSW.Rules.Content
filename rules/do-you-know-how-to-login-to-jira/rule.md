 Although we use Windows Domain authentication over LDAP, the domain domain is not required and the username must be in all lowercase. The url for SSW is [http://jira.ssw.com.au/](/Pages/HowdoIsignintoJira.aspx) <br>​​ 
If you're outside the network you will need the VPN at the moment. We have a task to make it visible externally but we need more external IP addresses first.

You can track progress on this at: [NET-48](/Pages/HowdoIsignintoJira.aspx)

See screen below for sign in details
