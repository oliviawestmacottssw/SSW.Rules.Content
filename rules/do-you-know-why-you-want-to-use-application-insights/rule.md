<div><font size="2">Knowing the holistic health of your application is important once it has been deployed into production.

If there are any uncaught exceptions, you'll be able to drill into the code to pinpoint the problem. You can also find out what your users are doing with the application so that you can tune it to their needs in each development cycle.&#160;&#160;</em> ​</font></div>
