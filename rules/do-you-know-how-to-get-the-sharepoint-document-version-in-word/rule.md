We are always disappointed when adding version information to a Word document. When you use the Word version you get a number that indicates the number of times the document has been saved and not a proper version number. 

<br>It is possible to get the number into Word for the version of the document on the SharePoint document library.

**Follow the guide here** :     http://www.bryansgeekspeak.com/2009/03/moss-2007-show-sharepoint-version.html

**Note:** This also works in SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010.
