<p>​Always specify the schema prefix when creating stored procedures. This way you know that it will always be dbo.procedure_name no matter who is logged in when it is created.<br></p><p>There are 2 other benefits to including the schema prefix on all object references&#58;</p><ol><li>This prevents the database engine from checking for an object under the users schema first</li><li>Also avoids the issue where multiple plans are cached for the exact same statement/batch just because they were executed by users with different default schemas​.<br></li></ol><br>
