Imagine you’ve been on vacation for several weeks (lucky you!) and on returning you want to see what’s been happening in your project in your absence.&#160; If your project used a “team” within Microsoft Teams, you’d easily be able to review the team’s conversations and progress.

You can add Apps that let you, for example, be notified of any # uses in Twitter that you want to monitor, or Facebook Pages that you want to follow. This is great for the Marketing team!<br><br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">
