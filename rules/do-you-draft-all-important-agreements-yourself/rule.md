Any time you come to some verbal arrangement with an employee, client or&#160;contractor, which creates or varies a contract&#160;(for example changes to rates, deliverables etc), it's crucial you draft the agreement yourself.

<p>Sometimes, especially if you are an efficient manager and enjoy delegating, it's tempting to ask the other party to write up the change. This is a major risk&#58;</p>
<ol>
    <li>The other party may not even get around to drafting the agreement leaving you without a paper trail </li>
    <li>If they do draft the agreement it may not accurately reflect the conversation </li>
</ol>
<p>Take responsibility for any agreements you make. Draft them yourself and then send an email <a shape="rect" href="/do-you-prepare-then-confirm-conversations-decisions">&quot;as per our conversation&quot;</a>.</p>
