<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58;Can you really trust the other side to draft the agreement correctly?</span>
<p>Sometimes, especially if you are an efficient manager and enjoy delegating, it's tempting to ask the other party to write up the change. This is a major risk&#58;</p>
<ol>
    <li>The other party may not even get around to drafting the agreement leaving you without a paper trail</li>
    <li>If they do draft the agreement it may not accurately reflect the conversation</li>
</ol>
<p>Take responsibility for any agreements you make. Draft them yourself and then send an email <a href="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/PrepareAndConfirm.aspx">&quot;as per our conversation&quot;</a>.</p>
