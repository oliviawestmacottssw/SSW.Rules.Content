Any time you come to some verbal arrangement with an employee, client or contractor, which creates or varies a contract (for example changes to rates, deliverables etc.​), it's crucial you draft the agreement yourself.

<p>Sometimes, especially if you are an efficient manager and enjoy delegating, it's tempting to ask the other party to write up the change. This is a major risk:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The other party may not even get around to drafting the agreement leaving you without a paper trail </li>
    <li>If they do draft the agreement it may not accurately reflect the conversation </li>
</ol>
<p>Take responsibility for any agreements you make. Draft them yourself and then send an email <a shape="rect" href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=2b86d144-7041-41f3-92aa-d7d59b88149a">"as per our conversation"</a>.</p>
