Any time you come to some verbal arrangement with an employee, client or contractor, which creates or varies a contract (for example changes to rates, deliverables etc.​), it's crucial you draft the agreement yourself.

<p>Sometimes, especially if you are an efficient manager and enjoy delegating, it's tempting to ask the other party to write up the change. This is a major risk:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The other party may not even get around to drafting the agreement leaving you without a paper trail </li>
    <li>If they do draft the agreement it may not accurately reflect the conversation </li>
</ol>
<p>Take responsibility for any agreements you make. Draft them yourself and then send an email <a shape="rect" href=/do-you-prepare-then-confirm-conversations-decisions>"as per our conversation"</a>.</p>
