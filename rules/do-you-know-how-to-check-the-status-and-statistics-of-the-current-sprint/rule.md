<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="/PublishingImages/check-sprint-status.jpg" alt="run acceptance tests" />
<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">This Sprint currently has 2 failing tests (red), and one active test (blue). The blue indicates that the customer has not finished testing, and the red indicates that there is still work left for the developers. (This Results view is only available in MTM 2012)
