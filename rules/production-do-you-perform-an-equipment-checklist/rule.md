<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Nothing is worse or more embarrassing than forgetting a vital piece of equipment in the office when you are set to record a presentation in a few moments, so making sure you use a checklist before going to the shooting location is vital in order to ensure the production goes smoothly.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Remember, it is key to make sure that the speaker is kept happy and willing, so do not keep them waiting for unnecessary periods of time.
