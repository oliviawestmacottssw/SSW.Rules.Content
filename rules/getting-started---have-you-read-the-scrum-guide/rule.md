 ​Everyone who will be involved in Scrum (pigs and chickens alike) should have read and understood the Scrum guide.  


Understanding the concepts of Scrum is easy; implementing it is hard!
![](/PublishingImages/ScrumChickenPig.jpg)Figure: It's handy to know who the pigs and chickens are. The word "commit" and this silly chicken and pig story, were removed from the Scrum Guide 2011.


Everyone should:

1. Read the <br>      [Scrum Guide](https&#58;//www.scrum.org/Scrum-Guide).
2. Take the <br>      [Scrum Open assessment](http&#58;//www.scrum.org/scrumopen/) and get at least 75% to be “Certified Scrum 1”
3. Watch the awesome video 'Scrum in 10 minutes'   <br>
