<p>As an Account Manager you'll frequently be required to find a free resource to put          onto a project. Instead of going around and asking everyone “Who’s free          next week?”, you should use the CRM Service Calendar. </p><p>The calendar provides          a one page view of everyone’s availability for a given time period. Here’s          what you need to do to access it&#58;                  </p><div aria-labelledby="ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_Content_label" style="display&#58;inline;"><ol><li>Go to <a href="http&#58;//crm.ssw.com.au/"><font color="#3a66cc">http&#58;//crm.ssw.com.au</font></a></li><li>Click Service | Service Calendar</li><li>Choose Month, Week, or Day view to suit yoru needs</li></ol><p>&#160;</p><p>All of the Appointments in the Service Calendar will also sync to the developers' outlook calendars, keeping them up to date with where they need to be, when.</p><p>You have multiple options of ways to fill this data, which you can see in <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterCRMForUsers/Pages/How-to-book-developers-for-a-project.aspx">Scheduling - Do you know how to book developers for a project?</a></p></div>

          However, the out of the box CRM service&#160;calendar has some limitations&#58;</p><ol>
            <li>&quot;Service Calendar&quot; link on left navigation does not appear when outlook is opened.
              You can solve this problem by modifying CRM's default sitemap. See <a class="external" href="http&#58;//support.microsoft.com/kb/916921">Microsoft KB Article</a> for more details.</li><li>CRM Service Scheduler creates an appointment in outlook for the scheduler and
the resources when scheduling an appointment. This causes a problem for the sales
              person because he has to schedule a lot of service activities for different resources as
              CRM will create all the appointments in his outlook calendar and makes it impossible
              for him to track his own appointments. </li></ol><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right&#58;0px;"><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right&#58;0px;"><p>To work around this issue, you can&#58; </p></blockquote></blockquote><ol><ol><li>Create a user account for your sales team to schedule all the bookings in CRM or</li><li>Set the Owner of the appointments to be the person being booked</li></ol></ol>
