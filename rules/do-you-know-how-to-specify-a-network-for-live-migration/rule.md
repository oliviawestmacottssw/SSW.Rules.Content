<p>It is important have the Live Migration and Cluster traffic on a separate network interface than the iSCSI or SAN traffic. If you do not you will see a performance hit while migrating virtual machines and the process will be a lot slower.</p>

<p>To specify the roles of each network adapter&#58;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Failover Cluster Manager</li>
<li>Expand the Networks section and you will see all of your network adapters listed</li>
<li>Right click on the network that you are using for LAN and ISCSI and make sure that the following setting is selected</li>

<p>This setting prevents ISCSI and LAN traffic from going over the cluster network</p>
