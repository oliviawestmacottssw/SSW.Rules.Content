To update a rule category name, please follow these steps:

<!--endintro-->

1. **Rename “category name" in metadata:** 
Go to [https://rules.ssw.com.au/\_layouts/15/termstoremanager.aspx?tsid=eacc332d045a40e1bcc10498d65b767f](/_layouts/15/termstoremanager.aspx?tsid=eacc332d045a40e1bcc10498d65b767f)
E.g. Search “Rules to Better Lync" to find it, double click the “term item title" to rename it to “Rules to Better Skype for Business (formerly Lync)" 
<dl class="image"><dt><img src="change-rule-category-name-1.jpg" alt="change-rule-category-name-1.jpg"></dt></dl>
2. **Rename “rule summary page" title:** 
Go to the “Rule Summary page", edit its title with the new name “Rules to Better Skype for Business (formerly Lync)": <dl class="image"><dt><img src="change-rule-category-name-2.jpg" alt="change-rule-category-name-2.jpg"></dt></dl>
3. **Update “rule category field value" for sub-rules:** 
    1. Go to [https://rules.ssw.com.au/Pages/Forms/Rule-Pages.aspx](/Pages/Forms/Rule-Pages.aspx), use the left navigation to filter and find all the rules under this category. Use the 1<sup>st</sup> “tick icon" to select all of them, then click “ **Files** " | “ **Check Out** " to check them out: <dl class="image" style="text-decoration:line-through;"><dt><img src="change-rule-category-name-3.jpg" alt="change-rule-category-name-3.jpg"></dt></dl>
    2. Use “Library" | “Quick Edit" to switch to “quick edit" mode: <dl class="image" style="text-decoration:line-through;"><dt><img src="change-rule-category-name-4.jpg" alt="change-rule-category-name-4.jpg"></dt></dl>
    3. Update the 1st row with new “category name", then you can use “copy & paste" to update all the rest in one goal. <dl class="image" style="text-decoration:line-through;"><dt><img src="change-rule-category-name-5.jpg" alt="change-rule-category-name-5.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true"></dt></dl>
    4. Check-in and publish all the rules when you finish your modification.
4. **[Optional] Rename “page URL"** 
If you want to rename the page URL too, please refer [https://rules.ssw.com.au/rename-a-rule](/Rename-a-rule)
