​It is helpful to the viewers to include still or animated captions (also known as lower thirds)&#160;in your videos because they enhance or add extra information that is not fully explained by the speakers. These are not to be confused with <em>titles, </em>which is the term given to text that appears on screen, such as&#160;the opening film credits, or &quot;1985 - New York City&quot;.

You can also use this section to put in links that are related to what was said in the video as evidence (similar to footnotes or a bibliography in a book). That way, you will gain more Google juice and it will make it easier for the Product Owner to review your captions.</p>
