<p>For argument's sake, it makes sense to refer to any text pop-up on screen as a 'caption'. ​It is helpful to the viewers to include still or animated captions (also known as lower thirds) in your videos because they enhance or add extra information that is not fully explained by the speakers. A sub-category of captions is <em>titles</em><em>, </em>which is the term given to identifying text​, such as the opening film credits, someone's name and job title or "1985 - New York City".</p>

<p>Now you cant really have just one type of caption. Have defined styles for different types of videos</p><p>eg. Here are the styles SSW use for their videos:</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt>​<img src="Why Choose SSW.jpg" alt="Why Choose SSW.jpg" style="width:600px;" />

You can also use this section to put in links that are related to what was said in the video as evidence (similar to footnotes or a bibliography in a book). That way, you will gain more Google juice and it will make it easier for the Product Owner to review your captions.</p>
