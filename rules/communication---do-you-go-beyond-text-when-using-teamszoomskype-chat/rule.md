Communication can be difficult  (even if English is your first language!). It might be tempting to only communicate via IM, but this will not improve your skills or build a relationship as well as communicating verbally.

1. Stop: Just using IM
2. Start: Asking ‘Can I call you?’ 
...
3. Start: Using video call (if weak bandwidth just use it for the first 10 seconds)
4. Start: Make up for weak English by typing while speaking

Figure: A group call should look like this 

Here are some tips to have a better call:

1. Answer the call with video
2. Sound - Be ready with the headset already on (it looks disorganized plugging it in after you take the call)
3. Sound - Check the sound quality of the microphone - you need a good mic and it should be close to your mouth - if you are using the laptop mic, sit in close.
4. Video - Check the image quality of the camera. Beware of the angle of the camera - the ones with thin bezels now put the camera at the base, looking up your nose. Avoid them.
5. Consider what is in the background (\*\*link to the rule to better video on this one)
6. Help the other person by taking a screenshot and giving them a mark /10 with good and bad feedback of the call quality and background.
