<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<h2>Application Core (the grey stuff)</h2>
<p>This should be the big meaty part of the application where the domain logic resides. </p>
<h2>Domain Model</h2>
<p>In the very centre we see the Domain Model, which represents the state and behaviour combination that models truth for the organization and is only coupled to itself.</p>
<h2>Repository Interfaces</h2>
<p>The first layer around the Domain Model is typically where we find interfaces that provide object saving and retrieving behaviour.&#160;<br>The object saving behaviour is not in the application core, however, because it typically involves a database.&#160; Only the interface is&#160;in the application core.&#160; The actual implementation is a dependency which is injected. </p>
<h2>Business Logic Interfaces</h2>
<p>Business logic is also exposed via interfaces to provide decoupling of business logic. <br>Examples of where this is useful include substituting a FacebookNotificationService for an EmailNotificationService or a FedExShippingCalculator for a DHLShippingCalculator</p>
<h2>Clients (the red stuff)</h2>
<p>The outer layer is reserved for things that change often.&#160; E.g. UI and the other applications that consume the Application Core.&#160;<br>This includes the MVC project.<br>Any interface dependencies in factories, services, repositories, etc, are injected into the domain by the controller.<br>This means any constructor-injected interfaces in domain classes are resolved automatically by the IoC container.</p>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Dependencies are implementations of interfaces defined in&#160;Repository and Business Logic Interfaces&#160;and&#160;Domain.<br>These classes are specific implementations and can be coupled to a particular method of data access, or specific service technology.<br>e.g. this is where the EF DbContext is implemented, as well as things like logging, email sending, etc.<br>These dependencies are injected into the application core. <br>Because the Application core only relies on abstractions of the dependencies, it is easy to update them.<br>The Onion Architecture relies heavily on the&#160;<a href="http&#58;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">Dependency Inversion principle</a>and other <a href="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulestobetterArchitectureandCodeReview/Pages/DoYouKnowCommonDesignPrinciples.aspx">SOLID principles</a>.</p>
