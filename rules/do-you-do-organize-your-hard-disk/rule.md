When you choose a location in OneDrive, it will always create the main root folder called &quot;OneDrive - (YourOrganization)&quot;. You should select the &quot;Data&lt;YourUsername&gt;&quot; folder to store the &quot;OneDrive&quot; folder, and then store all your files in it.<br>E.g. Create a folder in C&#58; with Data and your username, for example,&#160;&quot;C&#58;\DataKaiqueBiancatti&quot;, and choose that folder to be your main OneDrive folder. It will automatically create a new folder inside it&#58;<br></p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/onedrive.png" alt="onedrive.png" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Location of&#160;<strong style="color&#58;#444444;">Data&lt;YourUserName&gt; with OneDrive -&#160;(YourOrganization) folder in it </strong></dd></dl><p></p><blockquote><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​<img src="/PublishingImages/OneDrive.jpg" alt="OneDrive.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br><strong>Figure&#58; Good Example - Backup is being done automatically</strong></p></blockquote><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><strong>3.
