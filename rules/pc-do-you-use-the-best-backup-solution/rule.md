<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​​​​OneDrive<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">OneDrive from Microsoft is a simple and powerful application to do your cloud backups, for free. It comes installed in Windows already (starting from Windows 8 onwards), and offers up to 5GB of storage space for its users.&#160;<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">OneDrive for Business (Recommended)<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​OneDrive for Business shares its name with OneDrive, but gives a different product. This service is paid, but gives you a good return for your investment. OneDrive for Business comes with Office 365, so it is much more suited for business who already have a subscription of the service, or who need to more control over the backups and files. OneDrive for Business uses the Sharepoint structure (differently&#160;from&#160;OneDrive) to give users much more storage space than the normal one.<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Dropbox<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Lots of users use Dropbox because of its easy-to-use interface and amount of storage space. The service is pretty similar to Google Drive and works well in any environment.<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Google Drive<br></dd><p>​Google Drive is Google's solution to cloud backup and storage, and works well. You have quite a lot of space for free, and it works even better if you are already using Google's ecosystem of software and services.</p><p><br></p><p>All services work very well and you can mix and match, and use them all together if you want to. However, for business needs, we recommend using OneDrive for Business, which gives a lot of storage space and control for System Administrators of the company.<br></p>
