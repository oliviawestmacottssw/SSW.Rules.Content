<p>When you add an image to a website or application, follow the Microsoft Word standard and use <strong>&quot;Figure&#58; Description&quot;</strong> to describe your images.</p><p>It's the best way of ensuring you catch users' attention to the content of your page. When you're scanning a newspaper for interesting articles, you'll check out the pictures, read the accompanying description, and if it sounds interesting you'll go back and read the article.</p>
