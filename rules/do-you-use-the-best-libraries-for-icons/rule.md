When building a web application, it is common that you will need icons in the UI. Traditionally, this has been done with images (e.g. png, jpg) which leads to a lot of resource management.

<dl class="badImage">&lt;dt&gt; 
      <img alt="23-06-2014 11-20-02 AM.png" src="23-06-2014 11-20-02 AM.png" style="margin:5px;width:550px;">

This is simplified if you are using  **Bootstrap** , as it comes with a font-based icon library you can use in your web application. However, there is an even better third-party font-based icon library you should use when using Bootstrap:     [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

Font Awesome provides scalable vector icons that can be customized purely through CSS and some are completely free for commercial projects. This is great if youâ€™re tight on implementation deadlines and need generic icons in a hurry. In the ideal world, a specifically custom-designed icon set is the way to go.

Using it on your project is easy, just use your email and register on their website: [Get Started](https://fontawesome.com/start). Then you will be able to download and serve locally or use a CDN.

There are hundreds of icons. Here are a few commonly used ones:
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;<p><i id="yui_3_17_2_1_1403220586594_514" class="fa fa-trash-o fa-4x"> </i> 
         <i class="fa fa-plus fa-4x"></i> 
         <i id="yui_3_17_2_1_1403220586594_665" class="fa fa-refresh fa-4x"></i> 
         <i id="yui_3_17_2_1_1403220586594_667" class="fa fa-ok fa-4x"></i> 
         <i class="fa fa-remove fa-4x"></i> 
         <i class="fa fa-code fa-4x"></i> 
         <i class="fa fa-cloud-download fa-4x"> </i> 
         <br></p>&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Examples of Font Awesome icons<br></dd></dl>Read the  ["Basic Use" documentation](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/referencing-icons/basic-use).

If you are using  **Azure** , there is an awesome icon collection with several options for you to use: http://code.benco.io/icon-collection/
