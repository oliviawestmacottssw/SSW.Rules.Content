How often has the connection dropped out while a call center operator was trying to transfer you, or perhaps you get put straight through to someone's voicemail, meaning you need to hang up and call again. You should have a simple method for transferring calls that ensures the caller doesn't go around in circles or is left waiting for ages, wondering what is going on.&#160; <br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ul><li>When a caller asks to be transferred say &quot;Just putting you through&quot; (Instead of &quot;Hang on&quot; which doesn't give the caller any indication of what is going on).<br></li><li>IM e.g. Stephen&#58; &quot;Stephen, Colin from Microsoft Events, Line 1.&quot;</li><li>Stephen responds &quot;OK&quot;, and then pick up the call, following the rule above</li><li>If Stephen doesn't respond or messages &quot;Busy&quot;, Stephen is with a client or away from his desk. Then ask is there anything I can help you with?&#160; Take a message or try and assist the caller yourself</li></ul><p>More on&#160;<a href=/rules-to-better-im>Rules to Better Instant Messenger</a>.<br></p>
