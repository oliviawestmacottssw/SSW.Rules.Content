You should carry your timesheets with you all the time.
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>There are many ways developers can keep track of what they have been working on when it comes time to enter their timesheets.</p><p>If you're using <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterCRMForUsers/Pages/How-to-book-developers-for-a-project.aspx">CRM for bookings</a>, you will have an appointment every day in your outlook that you can use to know what client you worked for.</p><p>You can use Outlook sent items to see what work you completed in the day, especially if you're sending <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/DoYouIncludeUsefulDetailInYourDONEEmail.aspx">&quot;Done Emails&quot;</a>.</p><p>The best way to know what work you did is looking at your TFS check ins. The comments from these check-ins also make great comments for your timesheet entries. <a href="https&#58;//timepro.ssw.com.au/Home/Easy#/bored">SSW TimePro</a> automatically pulls these in for you.</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt>

   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example – Physical Diaries are no longer needed</dd></dl><p>Back in the day, people used to keep physical diaries to keep track of what work they did, and then they'd get the client to sign it each day they were on site to ensure they were communicating. This is now all covered by TFS check ins, CRM bookings, Outlook emails, and <a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DailyStandUpScrum.aspx">Daily Scrums</a>​ to ensure communication.</p>
