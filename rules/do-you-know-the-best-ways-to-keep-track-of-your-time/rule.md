<p><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">The goal is simple, accurate hours and good comments. </span></p><p><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">​There are&#160;4 ways developers can keep track of what they have been working on when the time comes to enter their timesheets&#58;</span></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ol><li>Fully electronic - Enter your timesheets daily 
      <strong>(recommended)</strong></li><li>Keep details in OneNote or Notepad++</li><li>Jot it down on paper (i.e. a physical diary)</li><li>Copy and paste your TFS check ins.

   <a href="/dones-do-you-include-useful-details-in-your-done-email">&quot;Done Emails&quot;</a>.</p><h3>Why have we moved away from Physical Diaries?</h3>
<p>Back in the day, people used to keep physical diaries to keep track of what work they did, and then they'd get the client to sign it each day they were on site to ensure they were communicating. This is now all covered by TFS check ins, CRM bookings, Outlook emails, and
