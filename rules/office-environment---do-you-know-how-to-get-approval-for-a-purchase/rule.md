When you need to spend money, don't assume you will get authorization â€“ make sure you have approval before spending the money.

<!--endintro-->

Let's have a look at the best way to get authorization:

1. Send an email to your boss, manager, or financial controller (or whoever the appropriate person is in your company) outlining what you want to purchase and why.
2. The email subject should be "Purchase Please - Request for xx"
3. If appropriate, include 2 or 3 quotes (call them "Option A, Option B etc") aiming to keep expenses low, and which you think is the best option
4. End the email with "Please approve"
5. Wait for an email back with "Approved" (prior to the purchase, or you may not get reimbursed later)
6. Forward a copy of the email to the financial controller with:
    * Your manager's approval (in the history)
    * Attach the tax invoice
    * State how the payment was made (whether you paid it yourself and need reimbursing or if it was on a company credit card, and if so, which one)
    * If this is for a client, include the Client ID/name
    * If it is for a client, include if it is to be on-charged (E.g. please invoice - add 20%)
