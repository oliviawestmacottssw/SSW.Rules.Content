Often times, web pages are dynamic. Most link scanners are not capable of submitting form information. The trick is to allow a &quot;door&quot; for link scanner go through to scan a dynamic section of a site. A common technique is to hard code&#160;hidden link with a query string at the bottom of the page that allows the link scanner to follow into the simulated user input. See our&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/KBResult.aspx?searchOn=ProdID&amp;searchFor=VSNET">knowledge base</a>&#160;page for example. You will have to look in the HTML source, and find the following code&#58; <br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<dl class="goodCode"><dt><pre>&lt;a href='KB.aspx?KBID=Q1097707'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1097707&lt;/strong&gt;-How do I turn Option Strict on by default in VB.NET?&lt;/a&gt;<br></pre></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Example source code - finding broken links<br></dd></dl><p> It will return all the knowledge base articles in a paged format.
