Often times, web pages are dynamic. Most link scanners are not capable of submitting form information. The trick is to allow a "door" for link scanner go through to scan a dynamic section of a site. A common technique is to hard code hidden link with a query string at the bottom of the page that allows the link scanner to follow into the simulated user input. See the following code for example: 

<!--endintro-->
<dl class="goodCode">&lt;dt&gt;<pre><a href="KB.aspx?KBID=Q1097707">Q1097707 - How do I turn Option Strict on by default in VB.NET?</a><br></pre>&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Example source code - finding broken links<br></dd></dl>
It will return all the knowledge base articles in a paged format. The link scanner will click the Next Page link and eventually scan through the entire knowledge base.

[Google webmaster tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters) and [Bing webmaster centre](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster/) are useful tools to monitor links.
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt; <img src="GoogleWebMaster.jpg" alt="In Google webmaster tools you can see all broken URLs, and even the pages who are linking to them (known as referrer, found in the 'Linked From' column)" data-pin-nopin="true" style="width:700px;"> <br> 
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: In Google webmaster tools you can see all broken URLs, and even the pages who are linking to them (known as referrer, found in the 'Linked From' column)</dd></dl><dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt; <img src="BingWebMaster.jpg" alt="In Bing webmaster center you can find the broken URL which is linked by the above URL" data-pin-nopin="true" style="width:700px;height:577px;"> &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: In Bing webmaster centre you can find the broken URL which is linked by the above URL<br></dd></dl>
We have a program called [SSW Link Auditor](https://sswlinkauditor.com/) to check for this rule.
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt; <img src="link-auditor-scan.jpg" alt="Link Auditor Scan Report" style="width:700px;height:405px;"> &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: SSW Link Auditor automatically locate broken links</dd></dl>
