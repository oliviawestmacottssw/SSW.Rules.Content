Apologies for making the code unmaintainable, apologies for not using well-known algorithms, apologies for writing 'clever' code, apologies for not having a good version control system, apologies for not having finished the job of writing the code, or for leaving vulnerabilities or flaws in the code, apologies for hand-optimizing C code in ugly ways.&quot;</em><br>- Uncle Bob (Robert Martin of 'Clean Code' fame)<br></p><p>​<br></p>
