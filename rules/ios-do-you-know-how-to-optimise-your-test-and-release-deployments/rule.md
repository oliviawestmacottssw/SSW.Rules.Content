When we upload our iOS builds to App Store Connect, we submit our Testflight and Release simultaneously<br><br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Your release cycle can be significantly impacted by Apple's review schedule. App Store and Testflight reviews can be very quick, but can also take up to three weeks under some circumstances. With this in mind, the best way to optimise your release time is to submit your build for App Store review at the same time as you submit it to Testflight.​<br></p><p><br></p><img src="/SiteAssets/ios-do-you-know-how-to-optimise-your-test-and-release-deployments/Screen%20Shot%202019-11-05%20at%2011.11.06%20am.png" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">​​Figure&#58; Bad Example - waiting for Testflight to complete before submitting for release<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><img src="/SiteAssets/ios-do-you-know-how-to-optimise-your-test-and-release-deployments/Screen%20Shot%202019-11-05%20at%2011.14.13%20am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-11-05 at 11.14.13 am.png" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​​Figure&#58; Good Example - App Store release submitted at the same time<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"></p><ol><li>Upload your build to App Store Connect.<br></li><li>When processing is completed, submit for testing in Testflight.<br></li><li>Immediately, prepare your app for submission to the App Store. <strong>Important</strong>&#58; set to Manual Release.<br></li><li>If you are using internal testers only (App Store Connect users), they can begin testing immediately.<br></li><li>If you are using external or public users, your build must be approved by Apple for testing.<br></li><li>Once both your App Store and Testflight builds have been approved, get a test pass (if its an internal app, walk up to a stakeholder in your office who has an iPhone and get them to test via Testflight).</li><li>Immediately upon receiving a test pass, in App Store Connect click Release.<br></li></ol><div><font color="#333333"><br></font></div><div><font color="#333333">BONUS&#58; Get the Testflight and Release submissions approved in preparation for your Sprint Review.
