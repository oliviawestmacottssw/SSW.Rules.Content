In Outlook, the Calendar control has a number of important features:

* Saturday and Sunday are displayed at the *end*.
* Days that have data associated with them are  **bold**
* The current day is highlighted with a box

Users are familiar with the Outlook calendar control. When the calendar control                      is used it should incorporate all of these features of the Outlook calendar                      control.
