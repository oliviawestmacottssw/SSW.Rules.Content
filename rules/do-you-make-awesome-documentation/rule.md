<p>There are 2 styles of documentation&#58;</p>

         <strong>What's &quot;Technical Debt&quot;?</strong></p><p>During a project, when you add functionality, you have a choice&#58; </p><p>One way&#160;is quick but messy - it will make further changes harder in the future (i.e. quick and dirty). </p><p>The other way is cleaner – it will make changes easier to do in the future, but will take longer to put in place.</p><p>'Technical Debt' is a metaphor to help us think about this problem. In this metaphor (often mentioned during Scrum software projects), doing things the quick and dirty way gives us a 'technical debt', which will have to be fixed later. Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments - in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development. </p><p>We can choose to continue paying the interest, or we can pay the debt up front by redoing the piece of work in the cleaner way.</p><p>The same principle is true with documentation. Using the 'old school' method will leave you with a build up of documentation that you will need to keep up-to-date as the project evolves.</p><p>Warning&#58; if you want to follow Scrum and have zero technical debt, then you have to throw away all documentation at the end of each sprint. If you do want to keep it, make sure you add it to your 
         <a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/Done-DefinitionOfDone.aspx">definition of done </a>to keep it updated.</p></div></dl>
