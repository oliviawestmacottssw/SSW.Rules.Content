<p>​<a href="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesForErrorHandling/Pages/use-the-best-exception-handling-framework.aspx">Do&#160;you use the best middle tier .Net libraries?</a>&#160;The best exception handling service&#160;is TFS&#160;Application Insights​. The best library is ELMAH.</p><p>Your users should never see the “yellow screen of death” in ASP.NET, or the “unhandled exception” message in a Windows application. Errors should always be caught and logged – preferably in a SQL database.</p><p><br></p>

You can also find out what your users are doing with the application so that you can tune it to their needs in each development cycle.

   <em>ELMAH with initial configuration for getting started quickly. ELMAH (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) is an application-wide error logging facility that is completely pluggable. It can be dynamically added to a running ASP.NET web application, or even all ASP.NET web applications on a machine, without any need for re-compilation or re-deployment.</em></p><p>
