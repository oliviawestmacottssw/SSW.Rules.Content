In default view for Associated Contact you cannot see the email address, it would           be better to customize it as an extra column.

<!--endintro-->
<dl class="badImage">          <dt>
            <img src="ContactView_NoEmail.jpg" alt="Associated Contact View without the email address">
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Figure: Associated Contact View without the email address</dd>
        </dl><dl class="goodImage">          <dt>
            <img src="ContactView_Email.jpg" alt="Associated Contact View with the email address"></dt>
          <dd>
            Figure: Associated Contact View with the email address</dd>
        </dl>
It is easy to do this by import the [customisations xml files](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/CRM.aspx#Customizations).
