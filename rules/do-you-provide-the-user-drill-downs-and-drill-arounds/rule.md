<p>Users should be able to navigate around your application without having to return to the main menu to open a related form.</p><p>Think about a summary report - users should always be able to "drill-down" to track a transaction to its original source.<br>
                   Think about a data entry form - users should always be able to "drill-down" to the look up table</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>There are four ways to provide drill-downs:</p><ol><li>Preferred - Use buttons to navigate around the application 
      <dl class="image"><dt>
            <img alt="SSW Timesheets - Add Timesheet Entry" src="../../assets/DrillDownDrillAround.gif" style="margin:5px;" />
         </dt><dd>Figure: Use named buttons to navigate around the application (Preferred)</dd></dl></li><li>Double click the control</li><li>Use buttons with three dots - an ellipsis (...) character 
      <dl class="goodImage"><dt>

         </dt><dd>Figure: Good Example - Use ellipses to navigate around the application</dd></dl></li><li>Use hyperlinks 
      <dl class="image"><dt>
            <img alt="Asset Form" src="../../assets/AssetForm.png" style="margin:5px;" />
         </dt><dd>Figure: Drill-downs implemented as links (an interesting alternative but a bit too much of a visual impact)</dd></dl></li></ol><p>Another handy thing to add for users is "drill-around". This is implemented by using a right mouse-click to activate context-sensitive links between related screens.</p>
