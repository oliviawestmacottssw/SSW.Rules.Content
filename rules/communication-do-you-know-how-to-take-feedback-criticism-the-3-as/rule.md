<p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">​&quot;​​Examples&#160;– When giving feedback, it’s often useful to use examples.&#160;Examples help make the feedback concrete.&#160;But, don’t allow the conversation to turn into a refutation of every example.&#160;I've been in conversations where the person I'm talking with wants to go through every example I have and explain why my interpretation is wrong.&#160;Be open to being wrong but don’t let it turn into point/counterpoint.&#160;Examples are only examples to support your feedback.​&quot;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​When receiving&#160;a generic&#160;criticism, it's natural to sometimes ask for examples to help you understand what type of behaviour is being alluded to, but be careful to not then become defensive or&#160;fixated on justifying that instance.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">If you feel you have some vital context to explain about that one example, make sure, as a minimum you end by ​saying &quot;<span class="ssw15-rteStyle-Highlight">...but I&#160;do take your point in general.</span>&quot;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">This will make the person who's giving you the feedback feel heard and that you have taken the criticism constructively. If you are also able to proactively suggest alternative behaviour for the future that would work for everyone, then you will build trust.&#160;<br></p>
