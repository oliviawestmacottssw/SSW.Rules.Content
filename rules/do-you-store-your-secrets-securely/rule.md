<p class="p1">Most systems will have variables that need to be stored securely; OpenId shared secret keys, connection strings and API tokens to name a few. </p><p class="p1">These secrets <strong>must not</strong> be stored in source control – it is insecure by nature, and basically means that it is sitting on everyone’s laptop, including the designers and that one manager guy who wrote hello world in 1996 and wants to look at the code.</p>

<p>​Instead, check in friendly development-only settings, ideally in Web.config or some JSON configuration, and have either your deployment system or your host (eg. Azure) fill in your secrets for you. They will encrypt and secure your secrets for you, and either do config transforms or supply environment variable overrides for them – a much nicer solution overall.​​</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
