  <p>To prevent spelling or grammatical errors in the text content of a rule, you should complete the following steps&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check the rule in Office Word for <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterTechnicalDocumentation.aspx#WordSpellingAndGrammarChecker" shape="rect">spelling or grammatical errors</a> </li>
    <li>Run Link Auditor on that page </li>
    <li>Check the report and fix the errors </li>
    <li>Check in the page and repeat steps 2-3 until Link Auditor has all green ticks </li>
</ul>
