  <p>In order to keep the rule you add is healthy and&#160;doesn't has&#160;any grammar&#160;or spelling mistake, you should follow the below steps once you finish adding a rule on SharePoint&#58;</p>
<ol>
    <li>Check the rule in MS Word&#160;to see <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout.aspx#WordSpellingAndGrammarChecker">if it has spelling or grammar mistakes</a> </li>
    <li>Run Link Auditor on that page </li>
    <li>Check the report and fix the error </li>
    <li>Check in the page and repeat step 2 and 3&#160; until Link Auditor get all green ticks </li>
</ol>
