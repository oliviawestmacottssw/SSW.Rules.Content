<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​​​​When reporting bugs and giving product feedback, it is essential that you are as descriptive as possible, so that the developer can reproduce the error to find out what the problem is or understand what features you are requesting.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Try to be as efficient as possible: <br></p><ol class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><li>If there is a GitHub backlog, add an issue and @mention relevant people<br></li><li>If there is a Azure DevOps backlog, add a PBI and @mention relevant people<br></li><li>If you don't know where the backlog is, or don't have access, then send an email <br></li></ol><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Try to have one issue/PBI/email per bug​/suggestion, but if the bugs/suggestions are related or very small (e.g. they are all on the same page) then you should group them together in a single email.​<br></p>
