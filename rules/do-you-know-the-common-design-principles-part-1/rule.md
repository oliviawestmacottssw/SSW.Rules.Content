<p>It is assumed knowledge that you know all 5 SOLID principles. If you don't, read about them on Uncle Bob's site above, or watch the <a href="http&#58;//www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=principles-oo-design&amp;highlight=">SOLID Pluralsight videos by Steve Smith.</a></p>
<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">What order?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Look for Single Responsibility&#160;Principle violations. These are the most common and are the source of many other issues. Reducing the size and complexity of your classes and methods will often resolve other problems.</li>
<li>Liskov Substitution and Dependency Inversion are the next most common violations, so keep an eye out for them next.</li>
<li>When teams first begin implementing Dependency Injection, it is common for them to generate bloated interfaces that violate the Interface Segregation Principle.<br></li>
</ol>
<p>After you have identified and corrected the most obvious broad principle violations, you can start drilling into the code&#160;and looking for&#160;localized code breaches. <a href="http&#58;//www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a> from JetBrains o​r&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.telerik.com/products/justcode.aspx">JustCode</a> from Telerik&#160;are invaluable tools once you get to this level.</p>
<p>Once you understand common design principles, look at <a href="/Pages/DoYouKnowCommonDesignPatterns.aspx">common design patterns</a> to help you follow them in your projects.</p>
