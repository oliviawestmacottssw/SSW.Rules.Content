A cold start happens when a cloud function is invoked for the first time or after a long time of no invocations. Basically, it takes the server (yes – there are servers!) a little bit longer to get the function ready the first time, so it’s ready to accept and process the request. If a function is invoked a second time, it will execute faster. There is a time period during which a function stays warm. If a function is invoked again during that time period – it will be executed fast.<br><br>
