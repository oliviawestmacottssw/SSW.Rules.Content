<p>Even though you may check your emails before sending, use SSW lookout to help you avoid mistakes, and even if you send/receive manually, there will still be times where you will send out an email with mistakes or incorrect content. </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>But all is not lost. If you go into your sent items, open up the offending email, and go into Actions | Recall this Message, outlook will attempt to delete the message from the recipient's inbox before he has a chance to read it. </p><span class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea"><img style="border-bottom&#58;0px solid;border-left&#58;0px solid;border-top&#58;0px solid;border-right&#58;0px solid;" border="0" alt="Recall a message" src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/RecallMessage.JPG" /> </span><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Actions | Recall this Message</span> 
<p>Outlook will tell you whether it was successful or not</p>
