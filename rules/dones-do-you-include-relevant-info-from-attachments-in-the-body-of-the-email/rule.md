When someone sends you a .doc file or images that are attached, when you reply done they (and others CCed) won't be able to see the appropriate history. If it is a word .doc or an image; open it and&#160;copy and paste the text/image into the footer. Don't leave it as an attachment. <div><b><span style="color&#58;#333333;font-family&#58;verdana, sans-serif;font-size&#58;9pt;"><br>Warning&#58; iPhones strip inline images<br></span></b><span style="color&#58;#333333;font-family&#58;verdana, sans-serif;font-size&#58;9pt;">If someone has replied to a beautifully crafted email (with inline images) with their iPhone, it will now be a clipped plain text email. <br></span><span style="color&#58;#333333;font-family&#58;verdana, sans-serif;font-size&#58;9pt;">So in such a case, you will want to skip that email and go back to the last HTML email and past in the extra response. For clarity add something like&#58;</span></div>
<div><p style="margin&#58;0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;line-height&#58;13.5pt;background-color&#58;white;"><span style="color&#58;#333333;font-family&#58;verdana, sans-serif;font-size&#58;9pt;"><font style="background-color&#58;#ffff00;">&quot;(fixed history to put back images - caused by Adam's iPhone)&quot;</font> </span></p>
<p style="margin&#58;0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color&#58;#1f497d;"><font face="Calibri">&#160;</font></span></p></div>
