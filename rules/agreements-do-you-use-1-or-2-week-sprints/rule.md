Depending on how much visibility you need on ongoing costs, you will have to decide whether to use 1 or 2 week development iterations.5
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>â€‹A 1 week sprint is for small projects (of &lt; 2 months) or if constant visibility into costs is an important factor, as it gives better feedback to the Product Owner (you)<br>Note&#58; This can be at the cost of increased overheads.</p>
<p>A 2 week sprint is the most common and allows a reasonable amount of work to be done for each release, while minimising Project Management overheads. </p>
<p>A 4 week sprint is a smell.</p>
<p>It is important to note that as more project management overheads are added, these will have to be paid for. The outcome is, as quoted by Ulysses Maclaren,&#160;&quot;The more you want to see how much you're spending, the more you'll spend&quot;. </p>
<p>It's important to find the right balance for you.<br></p>
