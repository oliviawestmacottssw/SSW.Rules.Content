                        &quot;A great man shows his greatness,&quot; said Carlyle, &quot;by the way he treats little men&quot;.
                        Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air shows, was returning
                        to his home in Los Angeles from an air show in San Diego. As described in the magazine
                        <i>Flight Operations</i>, at three hundred feet in the air, both engines suddenly
                        stopped. By deft manoeuvringâ€‹ he managed to land the plane, but it was badly damaged
                        although nobody was hurt.
                    </p>
 <p>
                        Hoover's first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplane's fuel.
                        Just as he suspected, the World War II propeller plane he had been flying had been
                        fuelled with jet fuel rather than gasoline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his
                        airplane. The young man was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down
                        his face as Hoover approached. He had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane
                        and could have caused the loss of three lives as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can imagine Hoover's anger. One could anticipate the tongue-lashing that this
                        proud and precise pilot would unleash for the carelessness. But Hoover didn't scold
                        the mechanic; he didn't even criticize him. Instead, he put his big arm around the
                        man's shoulders and said. &quot;To show you I'm sure that you'll never do this again,
                        I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow.&quot;
                    </p></div>

                    One of my staff, I wont tell you Edward's last name ;) , offered to help clean up
                    my laptop by backing up my files, reformatting and starting from scratch. For some
                    reason or another, all of my emails and client work were destroyed. Naturally I
                    was upset, but instead of coming down on him like a ton of bricks, I&#58;
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Went through the steps he took;</li>
                    <li>Identified where he did not do what he was supposed to; and</li>
                    <li>Showed him the company standard for backups.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    By giving him a second chance, I ensured that he and others would not make the same
                    mistake again, without making him feel any worse than he already did.
                </p>
