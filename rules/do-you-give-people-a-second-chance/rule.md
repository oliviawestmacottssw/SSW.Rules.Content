"A great man shows his greatness," said Carlyle, "by the way he treats little men".                         Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air shows, was returning                         to his home in Los Angeles from an air show in San Diego. As described in the magazine                         *Flight Operations*, at three hundred feet in the air, both engines suddenly                         stopped. By deft manoeuvring​ he managed to land the plane, but it was badly damaged                         although nobody was hurt.

Hoover's first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplane's fuel.                         Just as he suspected, the World War II propeller plane he had been flying had been                         fuelled with jet fuel rather than gasoline.

Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his                         airplane. The young man was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down                         his face as Hoover approached. He had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane                         and could have caused the loss of three lives as well.

You can imagine Hoover's anger. One could anticipate the tongue-lashing that this                         proud and precise pilot would unleash for the carelessness. But Hoover didn't scold                         the mechanic; he didn't even criticize him. Instead, he put his big arm around the                         man's shoulders and said. "To show you I'm sure that you'll never do this again,                         I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow."


One of my staff, I wont tell you Edward's last name ;) , offered to help clean up                     my laptop by backing up my files, reformatting and starting from scratch. For some                     reason or another, all of my emails and client work were destroyed. Naturally I                     was upset, but instead of coming down on him like a ton of bricks, I:

1. Went through the steps he took;
2. Identified where he did not do what he was supposed to; and
3. Showed him the company standard for backups.


By giving him a second chance, I ensured that he and others would not make the same                     mistake again, without making him feel any worse than he already did.
