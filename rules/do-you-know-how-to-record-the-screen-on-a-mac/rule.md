If you don't have Camtasia or ScreenFlow, you can use the built-in QuickTime Player to record the screen on Mac OSX.

<!--endintro-->

Open the QuickTime Player through the Applications folder, or by using search (Ctrl + Space) and typing QuickTime:
<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="QuickTime Player.png" src="QuickTime Player.png" style="width:650px;"></dt><dd> Figure: Search for QuickTime Player</dd></dl>
From QuickTime Player, you can start a new Screen Recording from the File menu:
<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="QuickTime new screen recording.png" src="QuickTime new screen recording.png"></dt><dd>Figure: QuickTime Player New Screen Recording </dd></dl>
In the Screen Recording window, you an select which microphone to use if you want to record audio:
<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="QuickTime Recorder.png" src="QuickTime Recorder.png"></dt><dd> Figure: Select your audio device</dd></dl>
**Tip:** Alternatively, you can use [Loom](https://www.useloom.com/) 
, which works as a Google Chrome extension.
