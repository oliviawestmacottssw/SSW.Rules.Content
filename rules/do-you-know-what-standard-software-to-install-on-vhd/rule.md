When setting up a computer in a corporate environment – you would usually have a standard image with all the software everyone uses already installed. This isn’t the case for VHD’s. Install the following software:

- SnagIt (Screen Capture)
- Adobe Acrobat Reader
- Adobe Flash Player
- Office Professional 2010
- SSW Diagnostics
- Skype
- Windows Live Messenger
- TeamViewer
