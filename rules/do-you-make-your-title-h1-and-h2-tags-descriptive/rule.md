<p>​​The <b><title></b>, <b><h1></b>, and <b><h2></b> tags need to be descriptive. They should briefly describe the purpose or content of the page. Have a look at the following two images. The first image is a bad example as the title bar and page heading are not very descriptive. The second image is a better example as title bar and page heading are more informative.​</p>
