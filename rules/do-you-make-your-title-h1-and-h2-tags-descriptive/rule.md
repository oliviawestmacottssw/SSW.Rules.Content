<p>The <b>&lt;title&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>, and <b>&lt;h2&gt;</b> tags need to be descriptive. They should briefly describe the purpose or content of the page. Have a look at the following two images. The first image is a bad example as the title bar and page heading are not very descriptive. The second image is a better example as title bar and page heading are more informative.​</p>
