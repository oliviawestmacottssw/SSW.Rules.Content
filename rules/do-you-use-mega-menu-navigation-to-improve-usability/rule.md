<p>So you started your site with simple navigation but then you find 
yourself a few years later with site navigation that is saturated with 
links and everything looks messy.</p><p>Mega menu allows you to present your links in groups 
and make use of typography, icons and supporting images to explain 
user's choices.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>By dividing site navigation into groups users will have better view of your site's structure at a glance and thus presenting them with meaningful choices. You can also group key pages together and give them emphasis.</p><p>Of course, don't use a mega dropdown menu just because you can. Turning your normal navigation into mega-menu whilst keeping it as one continuous level is generally a no-no. in the same manner, just because mega-menus have room, doesn't mean you should overload them.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
