<p>One of the most controversial issues we discuss is when to create branches.</p><p>Many smart people like creating braches e.g.

<h3>Why we don’t like branching</h3>
<ol><li>Merging is painful, complex and is a time consuming task that does not add value.</li><li>Often regressions are introduced as merges are missed and not merged back to trunk</li><li>The longer branches are, the more people that have worked on them... the more unpleasant the merge is going to be.<br> Amount of pain = size of the change * the amount of work on the trunk in that period</li><li>The more you need to create a branch, the harder it is going to be to merge it back into the trunk!</li><li>Branching impedes refactoring.<br> If a am working on a branch and perform sweeping renaming, and a developer working on another branch does the same – merging is nearly impossible.<br> This is 
      <strong>very</strong> likely to happen on code bases that require tidying when you have developers who believe in improving code as they go (see the
