A common mistake for developers is to say &quot;See you later, call me sometime next month&quot;. 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>On your last day of consulting with a client you should always book in the next date. Be aware of the main blockage people get, which the client is saying &quot;How about I check by calendar and get back to you?&quot;. And often this never happens. </p>
A better approach is to reduce the risk by&#58;
<ul>
    <li>saying that you are only pencilling it in and it can be cancelled, and </li>
    <li>bringing some urgency (by saying your calendar fills up quick) </li>
</ul>
<p>So try something like &quot;My calendar fills up really quick, how about I pencil you in.... How about we say 2 weeks time? Don't forget you can cancel it anytime.&quot; </p>

    <dd>Figure&#58; Plan ahead at the end of your day eg. &quot;How about we pencil in my next visit, say 2 weeks time?&quot; </dd></dl><p><strong>Note&#58; </strong>If, at the end of the day, work hasn't been fully tested, or is incomplete and you haven't been booked in for the next day, tell the Product Owner (PO) that issues may arise and further work is likely to be required. After the conversation, email the PO and CC your manager to confirm that further work is required.</p><p>E.g. &quot;As per our conversation, this work has not yet been tested and may still include bugs. At this stage you would prefer if we did not continue work tomorrow, but I do recommend that we come in and finish soon.&quot;</p><dl class="goodImage">
