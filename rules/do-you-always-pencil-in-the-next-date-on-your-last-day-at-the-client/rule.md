A common mistake for developers is to say &quot;See you later, call me sometime next month&quot;. 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>On your last day of consulting with a client you should always book in the next date. Be aware of the main blockage people get, which the client is saying &quot;How about I check by calendar and get back to you?&quot;. And often this never happens. </p>
A better approach is to reduce the risk by&#58;
<ul>
    <li>saying that you are only pencilling it in and it can be cancelled, and </li>
    <li>bringing some urgency (by saying your calendar fills up quick) </li>
</ul>
<p>So try something like &quot;My calendar fills up really quick, how about I pencil you in.... How about we say 2 weeks time? Don't forget you can cancel it anytime.&quot; </p>
