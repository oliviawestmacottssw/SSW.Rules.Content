​​​​The&#160;Scrum Master (not ScrumMaster), must schedule&#160;the Sprint Review, Retrospective and Planning&#160;meetings.
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Estimate how much time each meeting will require,&#160;then schedule a single&#160;calendar appointment to cater for the three meetings.&#160;<span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">When scheduling the calendar appointment, keep in mind the following&#58;</span></p><ul><li>Ideally, each of the three&#160;meetings should&#160;be time boxed to an hour for every week of their associated Sprint.</li><li>This time boxing does not mean the whole time will be taken up, just that you should not let the time for each meeting be exceeded.</li><li>With the Product Owner's help, the Scrum Team&#160;will need some time to update the Product Backlog after the Retrospective and before the Planning&#160;meeting.</li><li>People need breaks.</li><li>The Sprint officially finishes at the end of the Sprint Review m​eeting. The Sprint Retrospective marks the beginning of the next Sprint.</li><li>These meetings do not necessarily have to be held on a Friday or Monday. You can have a Sprint start and end on any day of the week.​</li></ul><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip"><span style="font-size&#58;13px;">​​​​​​​​​Tip&#58;&#160;It can&#160;be helpful to finish the Sprint Review with the first D​aily Scrum​</span></p><p>Schedule the meeting and invite the Scrum Team and any interested stakeholders.​</p><div><div class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox"><p>
