One of the best features of RayGun is the ability to track crash reports against deployments. This feature allows you to tell if a particular deployment has introduced a lot of new bugs or caused a regression of exceptions.

To set it up:

<!--endintro-->

1. Under Deployments
2. Select Octopus Deploy (Set up)
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt; <img src="raygun-octopus-1.jpg" alt="raygun-octopus-1.jpg"> &lt;/dt&gt;</dl>    Raygun will product you with a [PowerShell script](https://raygun.com/docs/deployments/octopus-deploy) to add into your octopus deployment steps that will call the RayGun API and log a new deployment
3. Trigger a new deployment
4. Then you’ll see the deployment in RayGun
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;<img src="raygun-octopus-2.png" alt="raygun-octopus-2.png">&lt;/dt&gt;</dl>    Drilling into a deployment you’ll see:

    * New errors
    * Regressions
    * Recurring errors
