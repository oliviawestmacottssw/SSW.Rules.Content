Managing up is providing your manager with an option to approve, rather than asking a general question.

I would advise the standard $165 + GST until he has more experience.
Please approve.

When you are giving someone multiple options you should:

* Limit the number of options to 3 to avoid "option overload" (more on <br>         [Choice Overload](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/choice-overload/) and [The Burden of Choice](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/more-tech-support/201011/the-burden-choice))
* Recommend one and state why


For example:


::: greybox
We want to integrate our database with our website so that customers can purchase online.

The choices:

 **Option A** <mark>(Recommended)</mark> -  Customize a ready-made solution - We are able to get rid of redundant features and change it to meet our requirements. It is cheaper than building a new solution from scratch.  
 **Option B** - Buy a ready-made solution - The ready-made solution is cheap but it does not have everything that we need and has unnecessary features. <br>      
 **Option C** - Build a new solution using a third party company - It will be expensive and it will take a long time.

Please let me know if you're happy to proceed with our recommendation, otherwise let me know if you have any questions.
