The Scrum Master (not ScrumMaster), must schedule the Sprint Review, Retrospective and Planning meetings.

<!--endintro-->

Estimate how much time each meeting will require, then schedule a single calendar appointment to cater to the three meetings. When scheduling the calendar appointment, keep in mind the following:

* Ideally, each of the three meetings should be time-boxed to an hour for every week of their associated Sprint.
* This timeboxing does not mean the whole time will be taken up, just that you should not let the time for each meeting be exceeded.
* With the Product Owner's help, the Scrum Team will need some time to update the Product Backlog after the Retrospective and before the Planning meeting.
* People need breaks.
* The Sprint officially finishes at the end of the Sprint Retrospective meeting. The Sprint Planning meeting marks the beginning of the next Sprint.
* These meetings do not necessarily have to be held on a Friday or Monday. You can have a Sprint start and end on any day of the week.
Mid week meetings are recommended so that the likelihood of it occurring on a public holiday long weekend is minimised.
* Since these meetings will occur every Sprint - set a recurrence on the calendar appointment (every 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks) so that people have the time blocked out well in advance.


**Tip:** It can be helpful to finish the Sprint Planning meeting with the first Daily Scrum

Schedule the meeting and invite the Scrum Team and any interested stakeholders.



**Required Attendees:** [Scrum Team]

Hi            **XXX** ,
 
This is a calendar appointment to hold the following three Scrum meetings:
Product Owner:  **XXX** 
Scrum Master:  **XXX** 
Task Board:            **XXX** 
 
 **Sprint Review Meeting** 
We will go through the user stories that have been completed and demonstrate them.
See rule [What happens at a Sprint Review Meeting](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=ce7cba56-e7a2-42c9-bdca-2445cf8f820b)? 
 
 **Sprint Retrospective Meeting** 
Sprint closed and new sprint starts.
We ask for feedback of the previous sprint so that we can ‚ÄòInspect and Adapt‚Äô.
See rule [What happens at a Sprint Retrospective Meeting](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=4f02d28d-5375-4530-abcb-0b541683bcbc)? 
 
 **Sprint Planning Meeting** 
We go through the backlog (aka to-do list), get more information, estimate and then prioritize. 
We then breakdown to tasks and commit to what we believe we can deliver for the next sprint.
See the rule [What happens at a Sprint Planning Meeting](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=ba8d0048-f440-42a6-90c0-8f79f0973d10)?

Regards,

**XXX**
