When writing an SSW&#160;technical script, it is important to remember that different developers will sometimes have conflicting opinions.
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
Getting to the end of a project only to have to go back to the script to make changes is deeply inefficient and creates unecessary extra workaround.&#160;â€‹As such, for an SSW technical script to be approved it must be taken for a <a href="https&#58;//www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAA&amp;url=http&#58;//rules.ssw.com.au/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/InternalTestPlease.aspx&amp;ei=_YvXUOvvLq-ZiQe21IBI&amp;usg=AFQjCNFCvf1Fg4rAXkivAT8ircMkrY2mkA&amp;sig2=TOeezHY66VWEQDubqLtCJQ&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169%2cd.aGc">'test please'</a>&#160;to both Adam Cogan and at least one other developer. It <strong>must </strong>be fully approved because changes to the script&#160;should not be accepted after the test please has been passed.&#160;The developer(s) and Adam should be made aware that if any changes are requested after the scripting stage it will fall back on them.
