When you create short URLs, it is worth considering exactly why you are shortening it.

Is it for space or readability? If it is for readability or you expect anyone to ever type it in, then consider making a friendly short URL.​​
 
I want to be able to type this URL in, but it is VERY long:

Bad example - People can’t easily type this URL in…. it is too long
Thanks Rob, that is great.

Bad example - How will I​ remember that?
