Lighthouse is an open-source tool built into Google Chrome that can audit for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more. Allowing you to improve the quality of web pages.

<!--endintro-->

You can run Lighthouse:

* In Chrome DevTools
* From the command line
* As a Node module


It runs a series of audits against a URL and then it generates a report on how well the page did. From there, you can use the failing audits as indicators on how to improve the page. Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it.
