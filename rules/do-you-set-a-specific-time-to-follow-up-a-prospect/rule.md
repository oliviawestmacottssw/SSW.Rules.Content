Sometimes the prospect is not ready at the end of the initial meeting to engage you for a spec review or ad-hoc work. Even if this is the case, it's really important you leave the meeting with a crystal clear future about the next stage and when that will be. Every prospect needs an intelligently scheduled follow-up activity.

So, at the end, ask the prospect:
<dl class="bad">                    &lt;dt&gt;
                     &quot;When would be a good time to meet next?&quot;<br>
                      Next Friday<br>
                     &quot;Cool, speak then&quot;<br>
                    &lt;/dt&gt;
                    <dd>
                        Figure&#58; Bad example&#58; The client really won't remember this
                    </dd>
                </dl><dl class="good">                    &lt;dt&gt;
                     &quot;When would be a good time to meet next?&quot;<br>
                      Next Friday<br>
                      &quot;Do you have your calendar?&quot;<br>
                       Sure, hold on<br>
                      &quot;What time suits best?&quot;<br>
                      Let's say 3pm<br>
                      &quot;Cool, Do you want to send the appointment or should I?&quot;
                    &lt;/dt&gt;
                    <dd>
                       Figure&#58; Good example&#58; Asking them lots of questions and setting a specific time and date for the next meeting (or phone call)
                    </dd>
                </dl>
This will ensure that the follow up meeting or phone call gets a much better chance of                      happening... Basically the prospect sets this up and will feel a certain indirect obligation.

The other way to schedule a follow upÂ is using [Followupthen](/do-you-follow-up-emails-effectively).
