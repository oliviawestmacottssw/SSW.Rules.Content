<p>Sometimes the prospect is not ready at the end of the initial meeting to engage you for a spec review or ad-hoc work. Even if this is the case, it's really important you leave the meeting with a crystal clear future about the next stage and when that will be. Every prospect needs an intelligently scheduled follow-up activity (preferrably in CRM).</p>

<p>
                So, at the end, ask the prospect&#58;
             </p>

               <dl class="bad">
                    <dt>
                     &quot;When would be a good time to meet next?&quot;<br>
                      Next Friday<br>
                     &quot;Cool, speak then&quot;<br>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Figure&#58; Bad example&#58; The client really won't remember this
                    </dd>
                </dl>
  
                <dl class="good">
                    <dt>
                     &quot;When would be a good time to meet next?&quot;<br>
                      Next Friday<br>
                      &quot;Do you have your calendar?&quot;<br>
                       Sure, hold on<br>
                      &quot;What time suits best?&quot;<br>
                      Let's say 3pm<br>
                      &quot;Cool, Do you want to send the appointment or should I?&quot;
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                       Figure&#58; Good example&#58; Asking them lots of questions and setting a specific time and date for the next meeting (or phone call)
                    </dd>
                </dl>
 

                <p>
                    This will ensure that the follow up meeting or phone call gets a much better chance of 
                    happening... Basically the prospect set this up and will feel a certain indirect obligation.
                </p>
