Sometimes the prospect is not ready at the end of the initial meeting to engage you for a spec review or ad-hoc work. Even if this is the case, it's really important you leave the meeting with a crystal clear future about the next stage and when that will be. Every prospect needs an intelligently scheduled follow-up activity.
 
So, at the end, ask the prospect:
                     "When would be a good time to meet next?"
<br>                      Next Friday
<br>                     "Cool, speak then"
                        Figure: Bad example: The client really won't remember this<br>                                         "When would be a good time to meet next?"
<br>                      Next Friday
<br>                      "Do you have your calendar?"
<br>                       Sure, hold on
<br>                      "What time suits best?"
<br>                      Let's say 3pm
<br>                      "Cool, Do you want to send the appointment or should I?"<br>                                           Figure: Good example: Asking them lots of questions and setting a specific time and date for the next meeting (or phone call)<br>                    
This will ensure that the follow up meeting or phone call gets a much better chance of                      happening... Basically the prospect sets this up and will feel a certain indirect obligation.

The other way to schedule a follow up is using [Followupthen](/do-you-follow-up-emails-effectively).
