Gated Checkins are great for verifying your project builds successfully before a checkin occurs, but the workflow and dialog messages can be difficult to follow.  Sometimes it’s not clear what you need to do next as a developer.


<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​​The process for a project with a Gated Checkin build is:</p><ol><li>The developer clicks 
      <strong>Check In</strong></li><li>Changes are not checked in, but are shelved and a build is queued</li><li>The developer is notified when a build succeeds and prompted to “Reconcile” their workspace</li></ol><p> 
   <strong>Note:</strong> This relies on the 
   <strong>Build Notifications</strong> tool running, which may not be the case.  If it’s not running, the developer has to manually reconcile their workspace before they can effectively continue working.</p> ​

   <strong>Build Notifications</strong> tool running or you click 
   <strong>Ignore</strong>, you will have to manually reconcile. There are a few ways to do this.</p><p>You can click 
   <strong>Check In</strong> again.  This will fail, but any files you’re trying to check in will be reconciled as a result.  You should definitely not do this if you’ve made additional changes since checking in.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
