When working on a Time and Materials basis there are two different management arrangements depending on what the client requires. 
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<a href="/Management/RulesToBeingSoftwareConsultants-DealingWithClients/Pages/" name="AdHocManagedWork"></a><p><b>A. Ad-Hoc Work</b> </p>
<p>Working on an ad-hoc basis allows tasks to be done as they are requested without any formal approval process. This is a simple approach but provides little in the way of management or accountability. This may be suitable for ongoing work such as application maintenance with longstanding clients OR working under a client manager.</p>
<p>The ad-hoc work approach should not generally be used for project work where the client wants SSW to manage project elements such as time, scope, quality and cost. </p>
<p><b>B. Managed Work (using Scrum)</b></p>
<p>The alternative is to work with a project manager (Scrum Master), specification and Sprint plans. In this approach, a method of project management is applied to provide control on the elements of time, scope, quality and cost. </p>
<p>This method is recommended for any work which is substantial and where the client wants a greater degree of control.&#160;</p>
