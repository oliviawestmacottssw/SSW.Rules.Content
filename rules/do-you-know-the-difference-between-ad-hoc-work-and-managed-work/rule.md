When working on a Time and Materials basis there are two different management arrangements depending on what the client requires. 
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p><b>A. Ad-Hoc Work</b> </p>
<p>Workin on an ad-hoc basis allows tasks to be done as they are requested without any formal approval process. This is a simple approach but provides little in the way of management or accountability. This may be suitable for ongoing work such as application maintenance with longstanding clients OR working under a client manager.</p>
<p>The ad-hoc work approach should not generally be used for project work where the client wants SSW to be manage project elements such as time, scope, quality and cost. <br><br>An exception exists where SSW provides resources to work under a non-SSW project manager who has responsibility for the project. </p>
<p><b>B. Managed Work (individual)</b></p>
<p>The alternative is to work with a project manager, specification and release plan. In this approach, a method of project management is applied to provide control on the elements of time, scope, quality and cost. </p>
<p>This method is recommended for any work which is substantial and where the client wants a greater degree of control.</p>
<div><b>C. Managed Work (a scrum team)</b></div>
<div><strong></strong>&#160;</div>
<div>The Scrum process has been proven to be very effective when developing software. You should offer a choice between a few different scrum teams for a clientâ€™s project. For example, at SSW, Account Managers send the <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Rules/Files/ScrumTeamsOptionEmailTemplate.docx"><font color="#3a66cc">SSW Scrum Teams Options email template</font></a> which explains this choice to our clients. Your consultants must be able to explain the Scrum methodology to our clients including the advantages. </div>
