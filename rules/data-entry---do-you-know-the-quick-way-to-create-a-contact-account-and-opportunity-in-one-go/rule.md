All CRM users should be able to walk through this simple workflow.
 
The process is:

1. In CRM, create a Lead
2. Convert it into an Opportunity, Contact and Account using the Qualify button
![Become familiar with the 'Convert Lead' button](/Communication/RulesToBetterCRMForUsers/PublishingImages/CRM_ConvertLead.jpg)Figure: Become familiar with the Qualify" button    Clicking on the "Qualify" button allows the automatic generation of Accounts, Contacts and Opportunities.

3. Deactivate the Lead
4. Create an Opportunity and Account
5. Automatically link the Opportunity to the Account and the Account to the Contact

This will save you substantial amount of time compared to creating and linking each one manually.
