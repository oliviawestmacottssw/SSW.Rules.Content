<p><span style="font-family&#58;'calibri','sans-serif';font-size&#58;11pt;">Code Coverage shows how much of your code is covered by tests and can be a useful tool for showing how effective your unit testing strategy is.&#160; However, it should be looked at with caution.</span></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ul><li>â€‹You should focus on quality not quantity of tests.</li>
<li>You should write tests for fragile code first and not waste time testing trivial methods</li>
<li>Remember the 80-20 rule - a very high test coverage is a noble goal but there are diminishing returns.</li>
<li>If you're modifying code, write&#160;the test first, then change the code, then run the test to make sure it passes.</li></ul>
