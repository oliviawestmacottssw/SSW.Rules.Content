1.&#160;Make sure your document library is configured to use versioning.<br>
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; TIP&#58; You can configure this in Settings | Versioning Settings

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>2.&#160;Make sure you are showing the version column in your document view. <span class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea"><img border="0" src="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSharePoint/PublishingImages/VersionColumn_Small.jpg" alt="Add a version column" style="border-width&#58;0px;border-style&#58;solid;" /></span></p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; TIP&#58; You can add the column by selecting Modify View</p>
<p>3.&#160;Whenever you edit the document and check it in, SharePoint will automatically increase the version number.<br>
4.&#160;If you need to send this document to a client then it is important to&#58;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;a.&#160;Save the file locally by selecting Send To | Download a Copy <span class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea"><img border="0" src="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSharePoint/PublishingImages/SaveFileLocally_Small.jpg" alt="Save a file locally " style="border-width&#58;0px;border-style&#58;solid;" /></span></p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; b.&#160;Add the version to the end of the filename e.g. Specifications_v2.0.docx<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; c.&#160;Then email it to the client.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; d.&#160;We do this so that we can track what version of the document was sent to the client.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; TIP&#58; If you are not working with SharePoint then we recommend you follow the rule <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterTechnicalDocumentation.aspx#VersionNumber">Do you include version numbers in your file names?</a></p>
