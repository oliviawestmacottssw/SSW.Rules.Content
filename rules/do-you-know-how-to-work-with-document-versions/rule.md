            <img border="0" src="VersionColumn_Small.jpg" alt="Add a version column" style="border-width:0px;border-style:solid;" />
         </dt></dl><p>TIP: You can add the column by selecting Modify View</p>​​</li><li>Whenever you edit the document and check it in, SharePoint will automatically increase the version number.</li><p>If you need to send this document to a client then it is important to: </p><ol><li>Save the file locally by selecting Send To | Download a Copy

            </dt></dl></li><li>Add the version to the end of the filename e.g. Specifications_v2.0.docx</li><li>Then email it to the client.</li><li>We do this so that we can track what version of the document was sent to the client.</li><p>​TIP: If you are not working with SharePoint then we recommend you follow the rule
