<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">All dates submitted to SQL Server must be in ISO format date. This ensures that language or database settings do not interfere with inserts and updates of data. You should&#160;NEVER&#160;need to change the default language of users or of the database in SQL Server. For example, any insert into a SQL Server database with Visual Basic should call Format(ctlStartDate,&quot;yyyy-mm-dd&quot;) or VB.NET Ctype(ctlStartDate.Text,Date).ToString(&quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot;) before attempting the insert or update. This will ensure consistency of treatment when dealing with dates in your SQL Server backend.​​<br></p>

The ISO representation of a date/time would be '20200701T0958', whereas for SQL you should send it as '2020​0701 09&#58;58'. This isn't even the extended ISO format as it is missing the obligatory &quot;T&quot; character (ref. section 5.4.1 of the standard).</p><p>(The standard does allow you to &quot;be omitted in applications where there is no risk of confusing&quot;, but it doesn't allow you to add a space or mix basic date with extended time.)</p><p>So, if you want to be absolutely correct then it may be best to remove the reference to ISO, so that your rule works for date/time as well as just dates.</p><p>The technical term used in the SQL help is &quot;Unseparated String Format&quot; (easily searched for).</p><p>The help specifies that this format is unaffected by the SET DATEFORMAT command (which depends on any locale settings for SQL Server or the computer it is installed on).</p><p>&quot;The SET DATEFORMAT session setting does not apply to all-numeric date entries (numeric entries without separators).
