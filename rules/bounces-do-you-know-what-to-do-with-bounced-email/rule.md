Having people report bounce back emails is frustrating and time consuming. The first thing to try when you get a report is to check that your mail server isn’t on a spam blacklist. An easy way to check this is via <a target="_blank" href="http&#58;//mxtoolbox.com/">MX Toolbox</a>.

<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Enter the domain to check</span>

<img src="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/MXToolbox-2.jpg" alt="Then select Blacklist Check" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" />
<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Then select &quot;Blacklist Check&quot;</span>

<img src="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/MXToolbox-3.jpg" alt="not blacklisted" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" />
<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Getting a zero is good, so you know that you are not blacklisted… so Step 1 is good</span>

<p>Next step check that you have primary and secondary (and even better tertiary) MX records setup and working.</p>

<img src="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/MXToolbox-4.jpg" alt="SMTP test" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" />
<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Seeing at least 2 MX records is good... Run an SMTP Test to test mail servers. So Step 2 is good</span> 

<p>If success on both steps the error is most likely on the senders side. Send them the an email to check their mail settings.</p>
