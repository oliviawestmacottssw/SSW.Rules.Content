Having people report bounce back emails is frustrating and time consuming. The first thing to try when you get a report is to check that your mail server isn’t on a spam blacklist. An easy way to check this is via <a href="http://mxtoolbox.com/" target="_blank">MX Toolbox</a>.

Run an SMTP Test to test mail servers. So Step 2 is good</span> <p>If success on both steps the error is most likely on the senders side. Send them the an email to check their mail settings.</p>
