<p>
                    A client will always prefer to be told ahead of time if a release is going to take
                    longer than anticipated. It gives them more control of what is going on. The other
                    opinion is landing them with an oversized invoice with no warning.

                <p>
                    For this reason, any developer working on a client project should send an updated
                    release plan to the relevant project manager every Friday so that they can call
                    the client, if needs be, to inform them of what's going on and ask &quot;do you want
                    us to continue?&quot;.
                </p>
                <dl class="bad">
                    <dt>$100k estimate. Calling the client when you reach $110k to say you have $20k to
                        go. </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Bad Example&#58; Not giving the client enough warning.

                    <dt>$100k estimate. Calling the client when you reach $80k to say you have $40k to go,
                        and does he want to continue? </dt>

                        Good Example&#58; Giving the client a warning ahead of time and asking for permission
