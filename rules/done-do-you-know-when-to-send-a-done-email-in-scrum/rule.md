  <p>Most devs don't send 'Done' emails. Do you really expect Product Owners to always be checking TFS?<br>
<br>
The better approach is&#58;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- If task/bug came from a client, when it is completed, send&#160;the 'Done'&#160;email to Product Owner.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;-&#160;If the task/bug is your breakdown of a user story (that the developer did to break down a big user story), then only send the ‘Done’ once the entire user story is complete.<br>
<strong>Note</strong>&#58; Send the ‘Done’ email to the <a shape="rect" href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx" target="_blank">Owner of that User Story</a>.</p>
<h2>Done tips&#58;</h2>
<p>- Include the Task #, Summary and link to the item in TWA. <br>
-&#160;Remember that all your tasks should be under 4 hours<br>
-&#160;Follow the Done Email rules<br>
-&#160;If you completed the task in a different way than previously discussed, mention it. <br>
-&#160;Make sure that every User Story has an Owner as per the rules.</p>

  <h2>If you are working on a task&#58;</h2>
<p>When you complete a Task that is part of a User Story you need to send a done email to the <a shape="rect" href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx" target="_blank"><font color="#000080">Owner of that Story</font></a>.</p>
<p>You only need to add the Task #, Summary and link to the item in WIWA. Remember that all your tasks should be <a shape="rect" href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/BreakLargeTasks.aspx" target="_blank"><font color="#000080">under 4 hours</font></a>, do spending&#160;lots of time on a <a shape="rect" target="_blank"><font color="#000080">Done Email</font></a> for a Task would be counter productive.&#160;Add more information if required, for example you may have completed the task a different way than previously discussed.&#160; </p>
<p>Make sure that <a shape="rect" href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx" target="_blank"><font color="#000080">every User Story has an Owner</font></a> as per the rules.</p>
<h2>If you are the owner of a story&#58;</h2>
<p>When the last task/bug of a user story is complete, you then send a <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterEmail.aspx#ReplyAndDelete" target="_blank"><font color="#000080">comprehensive done email</font></a> as per the rules when the story had been completed. Make sure you add a list of all of the Tasks that were completed as part of the story and the Done criteria that you completed.</p>
<p>Here is the&#160;<a shape="rect" href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DoYouGoBeyondDoneAndFollowADoneCriteria.aspx" target="_blank">Done Criteria </a>we followed&#58;</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; a. Compiled/Built&#160;locally&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; b. &gt;30%&#160;Code Coverage <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160; c. All unit tests passed </p>
<p>Then add an illustration to show this.</p>

<p>This is all designed to help you Scrum Team members (Product Owner, ScrumMaster and Team)&#160;keep a certain quality bar on completion of each chunk of work. Remember that you are not 'DONE' until your team says you are done.</p>
