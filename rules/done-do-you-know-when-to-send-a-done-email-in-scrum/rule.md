  <p>​​​Most devs don't send 'Done' emails. Do you really expect Product Owners to always be checking TFS?<br>
<br>
The better approach is&#58;<br><ul><li>If a task/bug came from a client when it is completed, send&#160;the 'Done'&#160;email to the Product Owner.</li><li>​If the task/bug is your breakdown of a PBI&#160;(that the developer did to break down a big user story), then only send the ‘Done’ once the entire user story is complete.</li></ul>

<strong>Note</strong>&#58; Send the ‘Done’ email to the <a shape="rect" href="/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx" target="_blank">Owner of that&#160;PBI</a>.</p>
<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Don​​​e tips&#58;</h3>
<ul><li>Include Task #, Summary, and link to the item in TWA. </li><li>Remember that all your tasks should be under 4 hours</li><li>Follow the Done Email rules</li><li>If you completed the task in a different way than previously discussed, mention it. </li><li>Make sure that every PBI&#160;has an Owner as per the rules.</li></ul>
