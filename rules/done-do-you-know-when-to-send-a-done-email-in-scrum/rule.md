Most devs don't send 'Done' emails. Do you really expect Product Owners to always be checking TFS?

 The better approach is:

* If a task/bug came from a client when it is completed, send the 'Done' email to the Product Owner.
* If the task/bug is your breakdown of a PBI (that the developer did to break down a big user story), then only send the ‘Done’ once the entire user story is complete.

**Note** : Send the ‘Done’ email to the [Owner of that PBI](/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx).
### Done tips:

* Include Task #, Summary, and link to the item in TWA.
* Remember that all your tasks should be under 4 hours
* Follow the Done Email rules
* If you completed the task in a different way than previously discussed, mention it.
* Make sure that every PBI has an Owner as per the rules.

### If you are working on a task:

When you complete a task that is part of a PBI you need to send a done email to the     [Owner of that Story](/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx).

You only need to add the Task #, Summary and link to the item in WIWA. Remember that all your tasks should be     [under 4 hours](/Pages/BreakLargeTasks.aspx), do spend lots of time on a     [Done Email](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=29d5ca5d-c191-475f-8db2-0086c44ca46c) for a Task would be counter productive. Add more information if required, for example you may have completed the task a different way than previously discussed.

Make sure that     [every PBI has an Owner](/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx) as per the rules.

### If you are the owner of a PBI:

When the last task/bug of a PBI is complete, you then send a     [comprehensive done email](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=29d5ca5d-c191-475f-8db2-0086c44ca46c) as per the rules when the story had been completed. Make sure you add a list of all of the Tasks that were completed as part of the story and the Done criteria that you completed.

Here is the [Done Criteria](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=6449ae79-ba88-447e-aa48-36173029a2af)we followed:

* Compiled/Built locally
* >30% Code Coverage
* All unit tests passed


Then add an illustration to show this.

This is all designed to help you Scrum Team members (Product Owner, Scrum Master and Team) keep a certain quality bar on completion of each chunk of work. Remember that you are not 'DONE' until your team says you are done.
