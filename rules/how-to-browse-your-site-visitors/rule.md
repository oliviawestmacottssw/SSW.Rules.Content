<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">in the Chat section, w​ith the Visitors activity, you can see is a real-time list of all the visitors currently on your website. It helps summarize all visitor information at a glance, including information about their browser, operating system, location, pages visited, and referral page. <br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>
   <strong>Monitoring your website visitors </strong></p><p>The Visitors activity gives you a birds-eye view of all the visitors on your website by putting them into different categories: 
   </p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="zendesk-visitors-1.png" alt="zendesk-visitors-1.png" /></dt></dl><ul><li>
      <strong>Incoming Chats: </strong>Visitors who have clicked the chat button and asked a question.</li><li>
      <strong>Chat Button Clicked: </strong>Visitors who have clicked the chat button but have yet to start a chat.</li><li>
      <strong>Trigger Activated: </strong>Visitors who have activated a trigger.</li><li>
      <strong>Currently Served: </strong>Visitors who are being currently served by other agents or yourself.</li><li>
      <strong>Active Visitors: </strong>Visitors who are moving around the website and clicking on links.  
      <br></li></ul><p>Click the <strong>List </strong>tab<strong> </strong>to view visitors in a list, as shown above, or click <strong>Visual</strong> to see visitors in visual mode.​<br><br></p><p>
   <strong>Grouping visitors </strong></p><p>This is the primary view of the Visitor List, but you can also monitor them in a number of different ways:</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="zendesk-visitors-2.png" alt="zendesk-visitors-2.png" />
   </dt></dl><ul><li>
      <strong>Activity:</strong> This is the default page and breaks down visitors based on the actions they have taken on your website.</li><li>
      <strong>Page Title:</strong> Groups visitors based on the page they are on.</li><li>
      <strong>Page URL:</strong> Groups visitors based on the URL/link they are on. This is normally different from the Page Title.</li><li>
      <strong>Country:</strong> Groups visitors based on the country they are from. The visitor's IP address tells us which country they are from.</li><li>
      <strong>Serving Agent:</strong> Groups visitors based on the agent who is serving them.</li><li>
      <strong>Department: </strong>Groups visitors based on department.<br></li><li>
      <strong>Browser:</strong> Groups visitors based on the browser they are using to access your website.</li><li>
      <strong>Search Engine:</strong> If the visitors arrived at your website through a search engine (e.g. Google), they will be grouped under this category.</li><li>
      <strong>Search Term: </strong>If the visitors typed in a search term to get to your website, they will be grouped in this section based on the term they used. 
      <br></li></ul><p>
   <strong>Using the High Load Dashboard (Premium)</strong></p><p>If you experience higher traffic (5000 or more concurrent visitors), you can switch to the High Load Dashboard. 
   <br></p><p>Unlike the standard Visitor List, the High Load Dashboard only shows Incoming and Currently Served chats. <br><br></p><p>
   <strong>To enable the High Load Dashboard</strong></p><ol><li>From the dashboard, go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Account</strong> &gt; <strong>Visitor List </strong>tab.</li><li>Select the <strong>High Load Dashboard </strong>check box.  
      <dl class="image"><dt><img src="zendesk-visitors-3.png" alt="zendesk-visitors-3.png" data-pin-nopin="true" />​<br></dt></dl></li><li>Click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li><li>Return to the Dashboard and verify that only Incoming and Currently served chats appear.</li></ol><p>
