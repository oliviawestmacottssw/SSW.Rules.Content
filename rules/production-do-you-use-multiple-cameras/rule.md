<p>To create more visually pleasing videos consider using a multi camera setup.</p>
<p>The benefit is that you can use the second camera to 'cut away' to (see Rule&#58; <a href="/Pages/Do-you-use-cutaways.aspx">http&#58;//rules.ssw.com.au/DesignandPresentation/RulesToBetterVideoRecording/Pages/Do-you-use-cutaways.aspx</a>) in the edit.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>â€‹If you are recording a long interview use two (identical) cameras, covering both the presenter and the interviewee.</p>

<p>This camera doesn't need to be identical to the main camera (but it is preferable over using a different camera). A camera such as the Flip hand held or even an iPhone can provide the necessary shots to make a video more interesting.</p>
