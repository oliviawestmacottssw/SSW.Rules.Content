<p>You can communicate better by using screenshots with balloons instead of only text. <a href="/Pages/HowToUseBalloons.aspx">Read the benefits of using screenshots here</a>.</p><p>We recommend you define a standard style for your balloons by changing the default colors and shape of balloons according to your branding.</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">More Information on SSW Branding<br></h3><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/snagit-bad-branding.jpg" alt="snagit-bad-branding.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - The&#160;balloon doesn't match our company&#160;colors</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>  <img src="/PublishingImages/snagit-good-branding.jpg" alt="snagit-good-branding.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example - Balloon follows SSW branding<br></dd></dl>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">To use SSW branding on your next screenshots, you should have the latest version of Snagit (which is the leading screen capture utility) and import the theme found here&#58;&#160;<a href="file&#58;//fileserver/DataSSW/DataSSWEmployees/Templates/SSW.snagtheme">\\fileserver\DataSSW\DataSSWEmployees\Templates\SSW.snagtheme</a>.<br></p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/snagit-ssw-theme.jpg" alt="snagit-ssw-theme.jpg" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; SSW theme already includes all tools you need with our branding</dd>  </dl><p>Instructions to create and use Snagit themes can be found at <a href="https&#58;//www.techsmith.com/tutorial-snagit-13-quick-style-themes.html?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=snagit&amp;utm_campaign=sw13">Quick Style Themes Tutorial</a>.<br></p><h1>Go Beyond with Presets<br></h1><p>We use a&#160;1px grey border. Presets can't be defined on the theme. Everyone has to add them on their own Snagit tools&#58;</p><ol><li>Select border tool (you need to add it first by <strong>[RMB on toolbar] | Customize | Effects | Border</strong>)</li><li>Set up 1px grey border</li><li>Add it to Quick Effects</li><li>Click on your new quick effect once to add the 1px grey border (be sure to <strong>Select All </strong>before copying, because Snagit has got problems with the selecting there…you could miss the added border)</li></ol><p> 
   <br>PS.&#160;You don’t have to do step 1, you can just add a border from <b>Effects | Borders</b> or only add it to the quick effects and access via <b>Effects | Quick Effects</b>. For the sake of simplicity and ease of access&#160;it’s easier to have this in the toolbar.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/snagit-presets.png" alt="snagit-presets.png" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Adding Presets to your SnagIt<br><br></dd></dl>
