<p>In marketing good timing is the key to a successful campaign.&#160;As a smart marketer you need to remember that some campaigns can take weeks or even months to start heating up whilst others can take just a few days.</p>
<p>For example SSW have found that when we plan to market our training events, the best time for an aggressive direct mail and telemarketing campaign is 4 weeks prior to the event. Any sooner than that and the prospects will often ask you to call again when it comes closer to the date. If you start your marketing for your events too late, like 5 days prior to the event, your chances of making a sale decrease significantly. Remember that people often need to gain management approval for the funding and time off work. Only rarely will you find someone willing to book in just a few days prior to the event.â€‹</p>
