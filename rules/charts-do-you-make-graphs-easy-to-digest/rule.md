<p>Graphs are a great way to display data in an easy to follow visual format. Some 
                    graphs, however, are easier to read than others. We recommend staying away from 
                    3-D Graphs and keeping it simple! If you have complex data, it's also a good 
                    idea to display 2 or 3 simpler graphs rather than one complex one - the aim of 
                    the game is to make digesting the information as simple as possible for your 
                    audience.
