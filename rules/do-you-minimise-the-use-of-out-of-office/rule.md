When you are on leave, you need to make sure that your mailbox is monitored. I find the best way to do this is by either&#58;

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <ul>
    <li>Asking someone (nicely) to check your mailbox if you are away for 3 days or more. This ensures that any important emails from clients are actioned or, </li>
    <li>Check it yourself every 3-4 days from home or wherever you are (Hawaii maybe!) </li>
</ul>

<font size="+0" class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Avoid using the Outlook Out of Office Assistant - This can fill up your clients' mailboxes with annoying auto-replies</font><br>
We do not use 'Out of Office - Automated Response' emails as they can clog up the clients' inboxes - they are considered to be annoying! For example, John gets 300 emails a week, if he goes away for 2 weeks and sets his auto-reply on, that's 600 auto-replies!</p>
