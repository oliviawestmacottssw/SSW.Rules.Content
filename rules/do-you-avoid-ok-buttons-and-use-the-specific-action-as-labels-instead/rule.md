While &quot;OK&quot; buttons were the standard convention with operating systems of the past, most recent applications use a more user-friendly approach to dialog boxes.
Instead of &quot;OK&quot; buttons to confirm the action they want to do, it’s more efficient and effective to give users a button that is labeled with the specific action.
