While &quot;OK&quot; buttons were the standard convention with operating systems of the past, web applications should&#160;use a more user-friendly approach to dialog boxes.
Instead of &quot;OK&quot; buttons to confirm an action the users want, it’s more efficient and effective to give them button that is labeled with that&#160;specific action.
