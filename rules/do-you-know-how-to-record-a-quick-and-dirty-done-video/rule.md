<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">When you've finished a PBI you should record a video to send to your Product Owner and anyone else that is interested. A 'Done'&#160;video&#160;is much better than a screenshot because you are proving&#160;the PBI workflow actually works. Even better,&#160;this video can double as documentation or&#160;release notes for your users. <br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Here's a quick video describing how to record and edit&#160;a quick done video. (Notice&#160;how it itself is also in the done video format?)<br></p>

   </p><ul><li>For a great 'Done Video' here are the key things to remember&#58;<br></li><li>Record it in one take. It doesn't matter if you stuff up or something goes wrong, treat it like you're having a conversation with them in the room. If it's super bad, just start again.<br></li><li>It's supposed to be quick and easy to make. If you spend too much time, you will be less likely to want to do it again in the future.<br></li><li>Be quick and concise, you don't want to waste other peoples'&#160;time either!<br></li><li>In your browser, remember to&#160;hide visible bookmark bars,&#160;browser tabs, add-in icons, and taskbar items to make it easier to view.&#160;<br></li><li>See Rule&#58;&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=d6c8ec14-f604-490a-a96a-82315794cd6b" target="_blank" style="background-color&#58;initial;">Do you make sure your screen recordings are easy to view?</a><br></li><li>In your&#160;browser, such as Chrome then you should first zoom to 125% ideally.&#160;<br></li><li>See Rule&#58;&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=01b38f0f-597f-4410-84de-465a705aabea" target="_blank" style="background-color&#58;initial;">Do you always zoom in when using a projector?</a><span style="background-color&#58;initial;">&#160; (or in this case&#160;before the recording a 'Done' video)</span><br></li><li>You want it readable on a mobile phone so&#160;record at 1920x1080 (aka 1080p). This gives the best balance of detail to size, for smaller screens.<br></li><li>Use zoom.us as the screen capture software.&#160;<br></li><li>Don't edit the video, Don't edit the video, just include your face at the beginning and end, using the fading functionality.<br><b style="background-color&#58;initial;">Tip&#58;</b><span style="background-color&#58;initial;"> If you are using Zoom you do not need to edit the video. Zoom includes your face automatically in the screen capture. Awesome!</span></li></ul><p><b></b></p><p><b>​Tip&#58; </b>Some offices have a professional setup.<br>E.g. SSW have the <b>Marantz Turret</b> hardware and desktop recording kit. The Turret is an ideal device to record these videos as it has a professional podcasting microphone, built-in light and good quality High Definition video camera.&#160;<br>
