​Many people like to use a whiteboard for collaborating and brainstorming, and this works quite well. But a whiteboard is a large ugly object that takes up a fair amount of room, often isn’t kept clean, and doesn’t allow for people to collaborate remotely. There are modern alternatives that work even better&#58;<br>
