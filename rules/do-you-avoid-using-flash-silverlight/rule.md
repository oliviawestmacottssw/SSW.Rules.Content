<p>
                    Public Websites done completely with Flash or Silverlight can be very eye-catching
                    and used in the right spots can achieve way more than you can ever achieve with
                    HTML. But beware because&#58;</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ul><li>It does not work on an iPhone or iPad</li><li>Flash/Silverlight can be slow loading, especially if the visitor is not using a
                        fast Internet connection. If your website doesn't load within 5 seconds, they're
                        gone. (There are techniques to overcome this)</li><li>It is bad for search engine rankings as there is no content for search engine spiders
                        to crawl through. (There are techniques to overcome this)</li><li>Navigation via the back button (and Browser History). (There are techniques to overcome
                        this)</li><li>Accessibility</li><li>Often seen with busy designs that turn off or distract visitors. Look at the biggest
                        ecommerce sites and you notice that none of them are Flash websites</li><li>In many cases it unnecessarily creates page bloat</li><li>You can *almost* get the same effects and functionality using jQuery, but faster
                        and lighter</li><li>You get an inconsistent UI if you use it for controls such as text boxes</li><li>Flash and Silverlight do not support CSS, so you need to follow unfamilar concepts
                        for re-skinning</li></ul><p>
                    Finally, and saddest of all, when Flash/Silverlight is used, it is normally â€‹over used.</p><div class="greyBox"><p>
                        <b>Footnote #1&#58;</b> It is clear that Flash has been quite successful - the penetration
                        of its run time is 99% on PCs.</p><p>
                        <b>Footnote #2&#58;</b> Silverlight got up to 80%. Microsoft could get near
                        100% if they included it with Windows Update.</p></div>
