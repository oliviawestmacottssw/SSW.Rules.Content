Most people have no idea of how to manage their inbox effectively. Emails should be treated as a list to do. As you complete a task you can just delete the email. 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>Your inbox should only contain 'tasks', that is actionable items that are on your list of things to do. Everything that is in your 'Inbox' (including sub folders) should only be to-do items. So do it now, delete all emails you have done, or move them out of the folder if you want to keep them for reference. </p>

<p>In fact you could go so far as to say you should not do anything unless you have an email telling you to do&#160;it (which is why we <a id="Send ourselves emails" href="/Pages/AssumeNecessaryTasks.aspx">send ourselves emails</a>). </p>
