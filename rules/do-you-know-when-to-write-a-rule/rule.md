  <p>The purpose of a rule is to effectively establish and record a process to guide employees in their day to day activities. </p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>Rules facilitate&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Consistency</li>
    <li>Coherent instruction</li>
    <li>A&#160;high standard of documentation</li>
    <li>Better understanding of processes</li>
    <li>Efficiency improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Only write a rule after the situation has happened more than once â€“ chances are it will happen again and a rule/standard should be created.</p>
