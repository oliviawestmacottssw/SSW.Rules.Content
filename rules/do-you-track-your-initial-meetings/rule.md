 When creating an appointment email for an initial meeting, make sure you include the words "**initial**" and "**meeting**" on the subject. 

Subject: Northwind project with SSW and Bob

 Figure: Bad subject - not clear it is an initial meeting

Subject: Initial meeting with SSW and Bob from Northwind
Subject: Initial phone meeting with SSW and Bob from Northwind

Figure: Good subjects - Make clear it is an initial meeting by having both words​ 


 
The idea behind it is that Power BI can then track and show this.
