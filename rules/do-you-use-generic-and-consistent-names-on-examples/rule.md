<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​It is a good idea to create a dummy company to represent all&#160;clients on internal documentation, including a made-up&#160;name for the person behind that company. At SSW, anytime we need&#160;an example for dealing with clients, we&#160;use&#160;the fake&#160;company called &quot;Northwind&quot; which is managed by the also fake client&#160;&quot;Mr. Bob Northwind&quot;,&#160;often&#160;referred to as just &quot;Bob&quot;.<br></p>
