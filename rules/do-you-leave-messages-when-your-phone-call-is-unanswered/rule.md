If you call a client or team member, and for some reasons he/she do not attend your call, then you MUST leave messages to ensure a response. 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Your messages must contain 
   <i>
      <b>your name (firstname and lastname)</b></i>,<i> 
      <b>purpose of calling</b></i>, and<i><b> your contact number</b></i>. Create a sense of urgency by giving them explicit time frames when you are available.</p><blockquote style="margin&#58;0px 0px 0px 40px;border&#58;none;padding&#58;0px;"><p><em>Hi Ms. Emma, this is Alvin. Please call me back, thanks.</em></p></blockquote><p><em></em></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Figure&#58; Bad Example - lacking in communication details, reason for calling and sense of urgency</strong></p><ol><dl class="good"><dt>
         <i>Hi Ms. Emma, this is Alvin Shen from SSW. I am calling to follow up our meeting yesterday about your company website. Please return my call on 9953 3000. The best time to reach me is between 9 and 11am today, or between 3 and 5pm tomorrow.&#160;Thank you.</i> </dt></dl></ol><p>
   <strong></strong><strong>Figure&#58; Good Example - This communicates important contact details, a reason for calling and implies a response is needed in the next day or so</strong></p><p>Confirm the voice message with an email. </p><p>There are several advantages leaving messages when your call is unanswered&#58;</p><ul><li>He/she may know who calls and be able to return your call.</li><li>If your message is urgent, he/she may return your call straight away (even though he/she is VERY busy.</li>
</ul>
