<p><strong>​Acceptance Tests</strong> (built by the developers) verify that the Acceptance Criteria are met.<br>
The goal is for teams to move beyond manual testing and implement automated testing <br>
eg. CodedUI tests, Telerik Tests etc<br>
 Test cases answer the question, "How do I test and what are the test steps?"</p>

<p class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox">Positive Test -When I enter ‘Adam’ in the Search box and click ‘Search’ I will see all entries starting with Adam in the Grid<br>
Negative Test - When I enter ‘zzz’ in the Search box and click ‘Search’ I will see *no* entries in the Grid<br>
Gold Plating - If no results are retuned show a message box ‘No results found’<br>
Gold Plating – Validation: If no search text is entered, the ‘Search’ button should be disabled<br>
Gold Plating – Validation: If the button is disable and search text is entered, the ‘Search’ button becomes enabled<br>
Gold Plating – Right clicking on a column header and using the ‘Sort’ functionality, sorts the data by that column<br>
Gold Plating – if a large set of results is returned, clicking the pagination page numbers shows the correct data<br>
Gold Plating – if a large set of results is returned and we are on page > 1, clicking the ‘Prev’ button goes to the previous page<br>
Gold Plating – if a large set of results is returned and we are on page 1, ‘Prev’ button does not error<br>
Gold Plating – if a large set of results is returned and we are on page < MaxPage, clicking the ‘Next’ button goes to the next page<br>
Gold Plating – if a large set of results is returned and we are on page = MaxPage, clicking the ‘Next’ button does not error<br>
