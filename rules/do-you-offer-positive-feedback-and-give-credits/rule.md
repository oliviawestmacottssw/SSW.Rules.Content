​Receiving positive feedback makes everyone feel good, peps them up and encourages them to do more of whatever they are doing.
Forgetting to recognize success                     means they have​ no motivation to succeed.
 
This is a simple rule - if someone goes beyond the call of duty, you thank them.​​​

**Bonus:** If you want to go further, you can tweet the link where you've found help from.
