 When you look at the Service Calendar, you want to be able to see, at a glance, who is working on what.



​To do this, the subject field of the appointments should be as follows:

   Client [Project] - Name[s]




The project name (in parentheses) is optional and only used if there is more than one project happening simultaneously.

You can have 1 or many names, dep​ending on the booking

Leave - Mehmet
