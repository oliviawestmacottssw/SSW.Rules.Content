<p>In your first month as an Accountant for a new company, you should print out the general ledger for the week and ask your boss to initial to say that the &quot;cheque numbers and memo descriptions are good&quot;.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>It's good to catch any mistakes early, so that you know the requirements early on and don't have to go back and fix up large amounts of data later. </p><p>Do whatever you have to do e.g. drive to your boss' house to get this done! It can save you days of work down the track.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img alt="General Ledger.jpg" src="/PublishingImages/General%20Ledger.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Weekly ledger</dd></dl>
