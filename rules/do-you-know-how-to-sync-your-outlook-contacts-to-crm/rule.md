<p>
          It can be useful to have the contacts you deal with regularly in your O​​utlook (for
          offline access and easy editing).
        </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Contacts that you create or are assigned to you (that have not been deactivated) are your "Active Contacts". 
   <span style="line-height:20.799999237060547px;">By default, t</span>hese are the only ones that will sync from CRM to your Outlook. You can, however configure this to use any criteria you want to decide which contacts to sync.​</p><p> To do this, in Outlook, click File | CRM | Option​s | Synchronization, and click Outlook Filters. </p><p>​<br></p><dl class="image"><dt>

   </dt><dd>Figure: Contact Synchronization enabled in MS Outlook 2013</dd></dl><p><span style="line-height:20.799999237060547px;">In Outlook, you can also choose which of your personal contacts you want to sync to CRM by using the toolbar option "Track" and "Set Parent" (i.e. company).​</span><span style="line-height:20.799999237060547px;">​</span><br></p><p>
   <strong>You now know how to do this, although it is not recommended</strong></p><p>
   <span style="line-height:1.6;">I</span><span style="line-height:1.6;">f your Outlook syn</span><span style="line-height:1.6;">cs to your mobile device, and you have a very large num</span><span style="line-height:1.6;">ber of active contacts (say more than 1,000), it is not a scalable option to sync from CRM as: </span></p><ul><li>
      <span style="line-height:1.6;">​</span><span style="line-height:1.6;">You may get too many contacts t​o easily deal with. </span><br></li><li>
      <span style="line-height:20.799999237060547px;">Things like voice recognition (e.g. Siri or Cortana) will find more false positives.</span></li></ul><p>Similar issues happen when you sync all your Facebook contacts. You have too many, duplicates, and a new problem to manage.</p><p><br></p>
