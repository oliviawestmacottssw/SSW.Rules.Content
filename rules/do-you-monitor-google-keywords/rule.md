Making sure that your site content to include specific keywords is just one part of the story. You need to constantly monitor how they perform.&#160;â€‹<br>

<p>The two main tools&#160;for keywords (and most of&#160;SEO research) are&#58;<ul><li><a href="http&#58;//ahrefs.com/">ahrefs.com</a><br></li><li><a href="http&#58;//semrush.com/">semrush.com</a><br></li></ul></p><p>It's better to use paid versions, but there are free versions with a limited set of features that are still useful.<br></p>
