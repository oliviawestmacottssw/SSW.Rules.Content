<p>Bosses are busy and forget. Just like you encourage a developer to book their own appointment <a href="/do-you-know-to-make-sure-that-you-book-the-next-appointment-before-you-leave-the-client">Do you know to make sure that you book the next appointment before you leave the client?</a> a boss should be the same.</p>
                
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>When your boss takes a call from someone wanting to book an appointment there are two options to offer the caller&#58;</p><ol><li>create a 'Outlook Calendar Appointment', or</li><li>call his PA and have him/her double check that they are free, and then create an Outlook Calendar Appointment</li></ol><p>It used to be that if the appointment was for the same day, your boss would have to take option 2 to keep the PA informed but now with mobile devices you should generally use option 1.</p>
