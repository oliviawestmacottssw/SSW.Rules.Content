 If you are presenting to people who you already know, then you have an enormous advantage over someone who is going to face an audience they have never previously met.<br> 
It is best to confirm who you are speaking to via a few slides. Then you can make subtle changes during your presentation so your audience gets:

- What is important for them
- Interesting to them
- Relevant to them
