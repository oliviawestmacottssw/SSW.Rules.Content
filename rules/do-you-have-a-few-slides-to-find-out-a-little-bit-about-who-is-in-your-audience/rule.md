If you are presenting to people who you already know, then you have an enormous advantage over someone who is going to face an audience they have never previously met.

It is best to confirm who you are speaking to via a few slides. Then you can make subtle changes during your presentation so your audience gets:

* What is important for them
* Interesting to them
* Relevant to them
