<div>​​​​Angular is everywhere.<br><br></div>Angular is up to version 7 - some people also call it Angular&#160;2+, but since version 4.0, it's just been known as <strong>Angular</strong>.&#160; This page is a set of rules and guidelines to get you up and running with Angular with the least pain possible. <br><br>Angular and React have been the 2 dominant front-end technologies for the last few years. We have been running our Angular Superpowers course that entire time, and I’m still amazed that every time we run the course, we sell out.&#160;<br><br>Of course, we update the course with every version, but it's still amazing because JavaScript frameworks have a reputation for being transitory. But these 2 frameworks&#160;have become entrenched in enterprises everywhere.<br><br><p><span style="color&#58;#cc4141;font-family&#58;&quot;segoe ui&quot;, &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, tahoma, arial, verdana, sans-serif;font-size&#58;18px;">Want&#160;to build an Angular application?&#160;</span><br></p><p>Check <a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Angular.aspx">SSW's Angular Consulting page</a>.<br></p>
